          The Lineage and Development of the Modern Chopsticks Wrapper

 	Chinese restaurants abound in the United States, with names like
Hunan Garden and Bamboo House, serving combination plates C1 through C20,
as well their Chef's specialties, hot and sour soup, and General Gau's Chicken
with pork fried rice. Take out, or dine in, you're bound to find yourself
with a styrofoam container, a plastic spoon, a few plastic buckets of dipping
sauce, and a set of splintery, poorly made chopsticks. As mundane and
stereotypical as these offerings may seem to the naked eye, attention to
details quickly reveals critical differences in the Chinese food experience
from one restaurant to another.

	Be it subtle changes in a recipe, utilizing peanuts instead of bamboo,
or the replacement of fried rice with white, or the selection of soups
available, the Chinese food experience varies greatly from one restaurant to
another. One quickly discovers that food such as "General Gau's Chicken"
varies so greatly from one restaurant to another that it becomes a curious
thing how so many different types of food may still be called the same thing.

 	In the olden days of China, recipes were handed down from parents
to their children, who made them very similarly for their children, and their
children's children. Nowadays, recipes are borrowed from the restaurant down
the street, or simply improvised based on educated guesses. This leads to a
natural, almost genetic, development of a wide variety of recipes for a
single dish, where only the tastiest versions survive.

	This genetic inheritance and variance is also recognizable in other
aspects of the Chinese food experience. Most notably, in the names of the 
restaurants, and their decor. But there is also a relatively unsung element
that generally goes unnoticed, except to an observant few. The poorly carved
chopsticks that you get in the take-out bag show a very wide range of
genetic variance, and prove to be both intriguing and humorous.

	The Chinese chopsticks wrapper is an amazing piece of genetic
development. Over the years, various chopstick producing companies borrowed
the design of the chopsticks wrapper and produced their own variants, each
inheriting bits and pieces of the design of the ancestral wrapper, and
adding their own changes. This has resulted in a 'family tree' of sorts for
the modern chopsticks wrapper. And, as with any geneological study, once
genetic patterns are identified, it becomes a quest to determine the
beginning of a particular trait, and how it is carried through the lineage.

	This document is the result of an indepth geneological study of
particular chopsticks wrapper traits, based on thirteen different specimens
taken from arbitrary Chinese food restaurants in the Boston area over the
last two years. High resolution scans are available by clicking on any of the
pictured wrappers for enhanced detail observation.

	Much of the lineage ordering of these wrappers can be determined
by examining the text on the wrappers and analyzing which mistakes were
fixed in which order. Also, the company producing the chopsticks generally
places its symbol or name at the top of the wrapper, on the front side near
the opening. This allows us to determine who inherited the design from whom.
Although, the most common symbol is not a company name, it is the symbol for
'happiness' printed twice. Literally, 'double happiness'. Appropriate for a
pair of chopsticks. 

	

Identifier: CS-A (4)
Generation: 1

Front Description:
	Company symbol at top, followed by four shrines with tassels
	each with a different Chinese symbol. Text is printed at the
	right side in a serif font.

	The English text reads: 
	-------------------------------------------------
	Welcome To Chinese Restaurant.
	please try your Nice Chinese Food With Chipsticks
	the traditional and typical of Chinese Glonous history.
	and cultual.

		BAMBOO CHOPSTLCKS
		PRODUCT OF CHINA
	-------------------------------------------------
Back Description:
	Decorative border and three images depicting the holding
        and usage of chopsticks. Also a circumscribed 'S' is
	in the upper left hand corner. It appears as if the 'S'
	is rotated 180 degrees.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Learn how to use your chopsticks

	Tuk under	thurnb
	and hcld firmly

	Add second chcostick
	hold it as you hold a pencil
	
	Hold tirst chopstick
	in originai position
	move the second one up and down
	Now you can pick up anything:

	PRODUCTOF
	CHINA
	-------------------------------------------------
	
	
Notes:
	This design is the most popular, and contains the most spelling
	mistakes passed down to other wrappers.

	To note, most of the spelling mistakes are due to some English
	characters looking like a combination of other characters. For
	example, in 'thurnb', the characters for 'r' and 'n' when placed
	close enough, form the 'm' character. It becomes apparent that
	the text was typed in by someone who had a printed or handwritten
	copy of the text, but did not know enough English to type it in
	correctly.
	



Identifier: CS-B (2)
Generation: 2, Parent=CS-A
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Same as parent
Back Description:
	Same as parent
Notes:
	The opening cut is is diagonal, while its parent's is curved. 
	The same company symbol is used, so it is inferred that it was 
	probably faster to produce the diagonally slotted opening 
	rather than the curved one, and hence this design
	developed economically.




Identifier: CS-C (1)
Generation: 3, Parent=CS-B
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Same design as parent, but the 'shrines' were re-drawn for clarity
	(most notably in the bases, but also in the tassles, and the tops).
	The spelling of "CHOPSTLCKS" was changed to "CHOPSTICKS". Also, 
	the letter "p" in "please" was capitalized to "Please". And the 
	period "." was removed from after "glonous history."

Back Description:
	Same figure drawings as parent. Type was re-set slightly smaller,
	thicker ink was used, and the border was re-drawn, this time
	without shadowing, and slightly different corner-pieces. The
	spelling and justification are the same as the parent.




Identifier: CS-D (3)
Generation: 4, Parent=CS-C
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Company name is printed as 'GOLDENSMELL' within circular icon
	featuring a boat and three characters. Otherwise the front
	of this wrapper is no different than its parent.

Back Description:
	Same as parent.

Notes:
	One should note the reversion to a semicircular cut-out in the
	opening, as opposed to the diagonal cut of the parent.




Identifier: CS-E (10)
Generation: 2, Parent=CS-A
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Company name is same as parent, but has top bar of kanji split. 
	Design is the same, but it has been completely redrawn, and 
	re-typeset. The shrines contain the same characters, but the 
	design of the tassles have changed considerably. The text has 
	been changed to a sans serif font.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Welcome to Chinese Restaurant.
	please try your Nice Chinese Food with Chopsticks.
	the traditional and typical of Chinese glonous history.
	and cultual.
	
		PAMBOO CHOPSTICKS
		I ODUCT OF CHINA
	-------------------------------------------------

Back Description:
	Completely redrawn. Same design. Better details in the hands, 
	and the wonton being picked up in the third frame appears
	more plump. The mysterious circle-s is present in the upper right,
	also in a sans-serif font.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Learn how to use your chopsticks
	
	Tuck under thurnb
	and hold firmly.
	
	Add second chopstick
	hold it as you hold
	a pencil.
	
	Hold first chopstick.
	In original position
	move the second
	one up and down
	Now you can pick
	up anything.
	
	PRODUCTOF
	CHINA
	-------------------------------------------------

Notes:
	Periods have been added everywhere in the text. Most lines end with
	a period now. The "p' in please was decapitalized again though.
	Spelling errors such as 'tuk', 'chcostick', and 'originai' were 
	fixed. "PAMBOO" and "I ODUCT" appear to be spelling mistakes
	and not printing errors, strangely enough.




Identifier: CS-F (8)
Generation: 2, Parent=CS-A
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Company name was changed to an icon of a tree with three characters.
	The 'shrines' are the same as the parent. The text has been modified
	with crude overlay cut-and-paste using a slightly different font.
	'glonous' was changed to 'glorious', and 'and cultual.' was changed
	to 'and cultural'. Also, 'CHOPSTLCKS' was corrected to 'CHOPSTICKS',
	as the entire lower right corner was retyped in the newer font.

Back Description:
	Back completely redrawn. Hands have less detail, border is thinner,
	wonton looks smaller. The circle-s is there in the corner. All spelling
	mistakes are fixed, 

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Learn how to use your chopsticks
	
	Tuck under thumb
	and hold firmly

	Add second chopstick
	hold it as you hold
	a pencil.

	Hold first chopstick 
	in original position
	move the second 
	one up and down.
	Now you can pick up anything

	PRODUCT OF CHINA
	-------------------------------------------------




Identifier: CS-G (12)
Generation: 2, Parent=CS-A
Image:
	
Front Description:
	A red-on-white variant of its parent, enlarged.
	The company name has changed to a diamond icon with two 
	characters in it. It appears that the 'shrine' artwork
	is the same, but flipped over the vertical axis (except
	for the characters) and slightly retouched. Probably laid
	out with a computer rather than carved ink-blocks.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Welcome to our restaurant.
	Please try to use chopsticks.
	the traditional eating utensil
	of Oriental cultures in the
	Far East
	-------------------------------------------------

Back Description:
	The circle-s has mysteriously disappeared from this version.
	The border appears the same, but cleaned up a bit. The
	artwork is the same for the three hand pictures, but the
	text has been changed. Also, this wrapper being slightly
	longer than its parent has the name and phone number of 
	the import company printed on the far right.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Learn how to use your chopsticks

	Tuck under thumb
	and hold firmly.

	Add second chopstick
	hold it as you hold
	a pencil

	Hold first chopstick
	in original position
	move the second
	one up and down.
	Now you can pick
	up anything!
	-------------------------------------------------

Notes:
	This a very 'Americanized' version of the original chopsticks
	wrapper. Any and all references to 'China' have been removed from 
	the text, and the language has been generalized to all 'Oriental 
	cultures'. This is clever marketing, but obvious changes to an astute 
	chopstick geneologist.




Identifier: CS-H (6)
Generation: 3, Parent=CS-E
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Wrapper is slightly damaged, and it is unclear who the distributor
	was. There is text at the left that says 'BAMBOO CHOPSTICK' in white 
	handwriting. The shrines were completely redrawn with different
	Chinese characters as well, possibly the same characters, using a
	more block-style rather than a script form.

	Text is in same font, but has spelling errors corrected. Also, 
	a nationalistic pitch is made with by changin 'Product of China'
	to read 'Product of the People's Republic Of China'.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Welcome to Chinese Restaurant.
	please try your Nice Chinese Food with Chopsticks.
	the traditional and typical of Chinese glorious history
	and culture.

	PRODUCT OF THE PEOPLE'S
	REPUBLIC OF CHINA
	-------------------------------------------------

Back Description:
	
	Text is the same as parent, but "PRODUCT OF CHINA" has been removed.
	A period was removed, and one was changed into an exclamation point
	at the end. The circle-s was also removed. The border was
	re-drawn thinner, and with a shadowing. The hand-figures
	were also redrawn, with careful precision to look almost exactly
	like the parent design.




Identifier: CS-I (13)
Generation: 4, Parent=CS-H
Image:
	
Front Description:
	Design of shrines appears more like a shrunken version of its grandparent
, CS-E, but the characters inside are obviously taken from CS-H. Also, a diagonal
cut was added. All text was removed from the front, and the name of the company
was added at the bottom (HAILIN), along with an icon featuring a globe in
front of an "H" symbol, with two character above and below.

Back Description:
	The back is white with red writing. The border was changed to resemble
	a series of flying birds. The back was completely changed to humorous
	poem, with no description of how to use the chopsticks (or pictures) 
	whatsoever.

	The English text reads:
	-------------------------------------------------
	Two little sticks
	They're made out of wood
	And they help you
	To pick up your lunch
 	Your lunch
	And if you practice

	Then you'd get good
	And you'll find you can pick up
	A bunch to munch
	Eat noodles with chopsticks
	Eat dumplings with chopsticks
	Eat sushi with chopsticks
	
	That's fish!
	Don't eat soup with your chopsticks
	That's no good with chopsticks
	And jello with slide off
	Your dish
	I eat with chopsticks

	Can you eat with chopsticks
	Doctor told us
	Be intell eat by using chopsticks
	Lots of people use chopsticks
	So try eat your chopsticks
	Right Now
