<h3><center>Adopted and proclaimed by General Assembly resolution 217
A (III) of 10 December 1948</center></h3>

<h4><b><i>Preamble</i></b></h4>

<ul>
   Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
   inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the
   foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,
   
   <p>Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted
   in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind,
   and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy
   freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has
   been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,
   </p>
   
   <p>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have
   recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and
   oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of
   law,</p>
   
   <p>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly
   relations between nations,</p>
   
   <p>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter
   reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity
   and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and
   women and have determined to promote social progress and better
   standards of life in larger freedom,</p>
   
   <p>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in
   cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal
   respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental
   freedoms,</p>
   
   <p>Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is
   of the greatest importance for the full realization of this
   pledge,</p>
   
   <p>Now, therefore,</p>
   
   <p>The General Assembly,</p>

   the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping
