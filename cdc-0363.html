<p>NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR: If you have any questions or feedback about
this whole thing (or if you just want to compliment me on my fine
drafting skills), I can be reached at:

</p>

<p>I only ask that you please be gentle.  If you piss me off, I'll
end up taking it out on my wife, kids or students, and I know you
don't want that on your conscience.</p>

<p><b><font size="+2">&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">FAST FORWARD</font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
first thing you should know about the legend of the Rocket Car
(especially if you got the story via E-mail or the Web) is that it's
been around a <i>lot</i> longer than most people think. It started
years ago, as a vague rumor passed from one guy to the next by word
of mouth, usually in bars or during lunch-break bullshit sessions.
The kind of story someone hears from a friend who read it in a
magazine, or a half-remembered newspaper story that someone read a
long time ago. It's a story that comes out of nowhere, gets passed
around for awhile, then dies out, like one of those weird strains of
flu that keep coming back every few years. The period of dormancy
varies, but whenever the story springs back to life, it seems to
spread like a grass fire. I used to think it was funny how the legend
of the Rocket Car managed to spread so far (and <i>fast</i>) purely
by word-of-mouth, but now that it's become a subject of Internet
interest, its popularity has become downright spooky.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you've never heard the legend before (in which case I can't imagine
why you'd be reading this), here's the bare bones of it: Once upon a
time, in some out-of-the way part of the country (take your pick of
locations) a maniac took a rocket of some sort, and mounted it on the
back of a car (make and model depend on automotive trends when the
story is told). The maniac then sped down a deserted stretch of
highway, and when he reached an appropriate spot, he lit the rocket.
Unfortunately, the rocket (which was either a JATO bottle, a surplus
ICBM engine, or an experimental Shuttle booster) proved to be far
more powerful than the maniac anticipated. The car reached an
incredible speed in a matter of seconds (somewhere between 150 miles
per hour and Warp 9) at which point the car's brakes and steering
became... ineffective. This development would've been bad enough on a
straightaway, but through some error in planning or navigation, the
maniac found himself hurtling down a road that curved sharply, not
far from where he ignited the rocket. When the car arrived at the
curve, it went straight ahead instead of negotiating the turn. Pilot
and car then flew like an arrow (for a distance only limited by the
imagination of the person telling the story), before crashing into an
inconveniently-placed mountainside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nifty.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm
sure this sounds pretty ridiculous if it's the first time you've
heard the Legend of the Rocket Car, but that's because I didn't go
out of my way to make it sound good. Most people <i>do </i>try to
make it sound convincing, embellishing the story with all sorts of
little facts and details to make it easier to swallow. I've
personally heard a dozen versions of this story over the past 20
years, and I'm constantly amazed at how the story grows, shrinks, and
generally mutates with each retelling. Maybe I notice these changes
more than most people because I've always paid close attention to
this particular rumor. Oh, I'm not a car expert or an aerospace
engineer or anything, and I really don't have much interest in urban
legends. Even if I did, from an intellectual point of view, this
story isn't as entertaining as some of the others that have come and
gone. The one about McDonalds shoveling worms into the grinders that
produce Big Macs, for instance, beats it by a mile. I only pay
attention to the Rocket Car legend because I'm 99% sure that I
started the whole thing in the spring of 1978.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not
intentionally, of course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,
before you draw any conclusions, I don't want you to get the
impression that I, myself, claim to be the maniac who drove the
Rocket Car into the wild blue yonder. I said I was probably
<i>responsible</i> for the rumor, not that I actually performed the
test flight. As far as I know, the flight in question never happened.
Like all legends, the root of the story might be true (or partially
true), but once the tale started circulating, the root was lost in
the embellishments. If the Legend of the Rocket Car survives, my
great-grandchildren will probably end up talking about a guy from
Lunartown who nailed an anti-matter pod onto an old Apollo moon-rover
and flew into the side of Tycho Crater.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's
how it goes with legends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I
said, I'm not a rocket scientist or motorhead. I don't even KNOW any
rocket scientists or motorheads. I'm a high-school biology teacher. I
know, this must sound like I'm the most unqualified person in the
world to give opinions about things like jet-propelled cars, but I
wasn't <i>always</i> a biology teacher. The fact that I'm a biology
teacher today is only relevant to the extent that it's responsible
for my writing this story down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last
year, a week or two before Thanksgiving, I was taking my class
through some of the particulars of evolution ("how human beings were
raised from monkeys" as one of my students phrased it). We were
discussing Charles Darwin and The Origin of Species when one of my
students asked me how Darwin's research ship ever got the name
"<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150923234335/http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/after.html">H.M.S. Beagle</a>".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damned
good question, when you stop and think about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
I've been teaching this subject for 11 years, it's rare when a
student asks a question I can't answer. But this one was a real
pisser. Anyone who's ever taught in a classroom knows that sometimes
you get a student that likes to play "Stump the Teacher". A kid who
asks questions he doesn't really care about, just to see if he can
find a gap in the teachers knowledge. Usually these questions are
pretty easy to evade or ignore (or even lie about) but sometimes one
will catch my interest. This was one of them. You have to admit, "The
Beagle" <i>is</i> a pretty dumb name for a ship that cruised the
Galapagos in search of exciting bird-beak variations. So I told the
student that I had no idea where the ship's name came from, but I'd
find out. After all, I've been teaching the same class for 11 years,
so I've amassed a pretty good variety of books on the subject. Surely
the answer would be in one of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hah. I
couldn't find the answer <i>anywhere</i>. My reference books
concerned themselves with headier subjects, the Scopes trial and
genetic mutations and whatnot, NOT the name of Darwin's boat. I
looked through every book I could find, but came up dry. After
exhausting all my research options, I was thinking about conceding
this particular round of Stump the Teacher when one of my kids asked
if I'd looked for the information on the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said
"Of course I looked there. It's the first thing I checked. Go play in
traffic."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth
be told, I not only <i>hadn't</i> checked the Web, I didn't know
<i>how</i> to check it. In addition to being a non-rocket scientist,
I'm not (or at least I wasn't) very interested in computers or the
Internet. I know this is a shameful thing for a teacher to say in
1998, but it's true. I kept <i>meaning</i> to take a look at the
Internet-connected computers in the school library, just to see what
all the hoo-hah was about, but I simply hadn't gotten around to it.
Actually I was a little bit intimidated by the machines, and kept
putting off the inevitable confrontation due to embarrassment. Sure,
I could've walked into the library during my free period, sat down at
one of the machines and tried to figure out what to do on my own, but
what if I couldn't make it work? It wouldn't be long before someone
spotted my baffled expression and realized I was completely lost. So
the next day I went to the library during my free period and asked
the librarian for help, feeling like Crocodile Dundee asking how to
work the bidet. But the librarian had obviously dealt with the
situation before, and gave me her ten-minute "Internet For Stupid
Teachers" course without making me feel any dumber than she had to.
As soon as she left me alone with Netscape running and a search
engine online, I typed "Darwin" into space provided, and let the
machine do its thing. When the results of my search started filling
the screen, the first thing I noticed was that there were over two
MILLION sites listed as being Darwin-related.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
second thing I noticed was that <i>none</i> of them seemed to pertain
to Charles Darwin, the most famous naturalist in history. Instead,
they all seemed to focus on "The Darwin Award", an "...honor
(posthumously) bestowed on people who did the most good for humanity
by removing themselves from the communal gene-pool".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
really isn't a bad idea, when you think about it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
course I expected this "award" to be a piece of tongue- in-cheek
humor, the sort of thing that used to make the rounds via smudgy
Xeroxes in the days before E-mail and the World Wide Web. And that's
exactly what it turned out to be. What I <i>wasn't</i> prepared for
was my very first encounter with the story of the Rocket Car in
print. Not only in print, but in a format that can reach around the
world. When I read the story, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry
or get nauseous, but I think if I were alone, I'd have done all
three. Based on the number of different Websites cross-referenced to
the word "Darwin", I'll bet that if you read the Rocket Car story
from a computer monitor, the version you saw looked something like
the one that follows. &nbsp;The text, anyway. The high-tech,
precision-drafted engineering diagrams are my own addition. Don't
bust my balls about them, either. I already told you that I'm not a
motorhead or a rocket scientist, and I'm no Leonardo da Vinci,
either.</p>

<p>The Arizona Highway Patrol came upon a pile of smoldering metal
embedded into the side of a cliff rising above the road at the apex
of a curve. The wreckage resembled the site of an airplane crash, but
it was a car. The type of car was unidentifiable at the scene. The
lab finally figured out what it was and what had happened.</p>

<p>It seems that a guy had somehow obtained a JATO unit (Jet Assisted
Take Off-actually a solid fuel rocket) that is used to give heavy
military transport planes an extra "push" for taking off from short
airfields. He had driven his Chevy Impala out into the desert and
found a long, straight stretch of road. Then he attached the JATO
unit to his car, jumped in, got up some speed and fired off the JATO!
</p>

<p>The facts as best could be determined are that the operator of the
1967 Impala hit JATO ignition at <img src="./cdc-0363_files/fig1a.jpg" width="393" height="649" align="left">a distance of approximately 3.0 miles from the
crash site. This was established by the prominent scorched and melted
asphalt at that location. The JATO, if operating properly, would have
reached maximum thrust within 5 seconds, causing the Chevy to reach
speeds well in excess of 350 mph and continuing at full power for an
additional 20-25 seconds. The driver, soon to be pilot, most likely
would have experienced G-forces usually reserved for dog-fighting
F-14 jocks under full afterburners, basically causing him to become
insignificant for the remainder of the event. However, the automobile
remained on the straight highway for about 2.5 miles (15-20)seconds
before the driver applied and completely melted the brakes, blowing
the tires and leaving thick rubber marks on the road surface, then
becoming airborne for an additional 1.4 miles and impacting the cliff
face at a height of 125 feet leaving a blackened crater 3 feet deep
in the rock.</p>

<p>Most of the driver's remains were not recoverable; however, small
fragments of bone, teeth and hair were extracted from the crater and
fingernail and bone shards were removed from a piece of debris
believed to be a portion of the steering wheel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I
said earlier, for the past 20 years I've kept an eye out for stories
like this, and I've heard plenty of them. But the stories I'd heard
up until then had always been vague and somewhat skimpy on technical
details, making them marginally easier to swallow. Or at least to
repeat. But the Darwin Award version was different. It was chock full
of numbers and specifics, which is always bad news for a legend. Oh,
<i>initially</i> it might make the story more believable, but
throwing in a lot of facts and figures also gives the non-believers
plenty of details they can use to refute the story. In the case of
the Darwin Awards version, I'm surprised that anyone, anywhere,
believed the story well enough to repeat it the first time. For
instance, there's the fact that this event was supposedly
investigated by the Arizona Highway Patrol. Well, that's not too hard
to check, is it? One call to the state police in Arizona would be all
it took to get a confirmation or denial. If you don't believe me,
give it a try. You'll get an irritated denial before you've even
finished asking the question. Actually, the AHP is so sick of
answering questions about this whole thing that they may well hang up
in your ear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't
feel like making a long-distance call just to have someone hang up on
you? Then ask yourself this: If the Darwin Award story is true, then
why was it never reported in the national media? Why has nobody ever
produced pictures of the crash site? And how about the unfortunate
"pilot"? Nobody was ever able to attach a name to this person?
Specify the location?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you
want to explain these questions away by blaming human error or police
indifference or whatever, that's okay. There's too much apathy and
incompetence in the world to pretend <i>that</i> couldn't be the
case. But if you look at the <i>physics</i> of the story, you'll see
that the whole pile of bullshit is impossible, regardless of the
human angle. It's simple stuff, too. You don't have to be an
aerospace engineer to see what I'm talking about. For instance, when
the Chevy left the road with its rocket still going full-blast, why
did it go in a straight line?&nbsp; Take a look at a missile
sometime. You'll notice that it's... missile-shaped. Nice pointy
nose, tail fins, stuff like that. It's built that way so it'll go in
a straight line. The 1967 Chevrolet was a nice looking car, sure. But
it doesn't look much like a missile. Mount a big rocket on a `67
Chevy and it <i>may</i> go straight as long as it's on the ground.
But once it got airborne, the weight of the engine would immediately
pull the nose down. And if the JATO was still blazing away, the car
would drill itself into the ground like a tent-spike before it got
fifty feet from the cliff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
story is obviously bullshit to anyone willing to give it a little
thought, but it persists, mainly because people <i>WANT</i> it to be
true. And most of those people are men. As a story that got its
start when it was still being shouted across pool tables in noisy
bars, women were left out of the loop until it hit the Internet. Sort
of like the story about the deadly gas that lies inside the core of a
golf ball. Little boys learn this one too, but not little girls. And
when the little boys grow up (to whatever extent they actually
<i>do</i> grow up), the Golf Ball Toxin story is replaced with the
Rocket Car story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
"urban legend" debunker attributes the huge popularity of this story
to the fact that it's "...a real-life version of the Road Runner
cartoon. Wile E. Coyote nails an Acme Jato Rocket onto the back of a
Chevy Impala and flies into a canyon wall."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Works
for me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
question is, how did such a story ever get started in the first
place? &nbsp;Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that
nobody would ever be dumb enough to <i>attempt</i> a stunt like this.
Anyone who followed the O.J. Simpson trial will probably agree that
there simply aren't any limits to the depths of human stupidity
anymore. It's just mighty unlikely that someone stupid enough to
pilot the Rocket Car would be smart enough to build it in the first
place. The story probably started with an event that that bears some
similarity to the final version, a much <i>smaller</i> event that
gradually evolved into the final legend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I
know for sure is that myself and three other guys were getting up to
some awfully weird shit out in the desert back in the spring of 1978,
shit that was <i>more</i> than weird enough to start the Legend of
the Rocket Car. And only <i>one</i> of us was stupid enough to be the
pilot in the Darwin Awards story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
least that's what I keep telling myself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./cdc-0363_files/carclif1.jpg" width="590" height="52" align="bottom"></p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">WHY THE ROCKET CAR DOESN'T
WORK</font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I
want to make clear from the start is that I'm not pissing on the
Rocket Car legend purely as an academic exercise. When my friends and
I set out to build the vehicle we test-fired in the spring of 1978, a
real-life jet-powered, road-traveling car was exactly what we had in
mind. Craig Breedlove was busy breaking land speed records in the
Spirit of America, Evel Knievel had graduated from "biker"&nbsp;to
"payload" while attempting to jump the Snake River Canyon a few years
earlier, and rocket-powered vehicles were a pretty popular notion.
Unfortunately, machines like this require a lot of time and money and
engineering skill to build and operate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My
friends and I had none of these things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
1978, I was 22 years old and still living with my parents. My father
owned a scrapyard, twenty-two acres of barren desert scrub ideally
suited to having junk thrown on it. The yard was a salvage
smorgasbord, covered with everything from dead water heaters to
junked airplane cockpits. And since we lived near a major Army
storage facility, a lot of the scrap my father bought and sold came
from government auctions. To be brutally honest, the main yard looked
like a cross between Sanford &amp; Sons and Apocalypse Now. My father
would go to the auctions held at the post from time to time, bid on
pre-marked lots of God only knew what, then send me out he next day
with the big flatbed to collect the latest pile of junk he'd bought.
Plenty of people who went to these auctions ended up with nothing
more than tons of unusable junk that was worth less than they paid
for it, but my Dad always seemed to find the lots that contained
valuable stuff. He also knew plenty of people who owned military
surplus stores, and usually had some idea of what was in demand and
what wasn't. But since the nearby Army base was a <i>huge</i> storage
depot, the auctions weren't the sort of affairs that the average
man-off-the-street would be interested in. The lots for sale were
usually measured by the ton, and if a lot seemed to have a few items
you were interested in, you had to buy the whole mess. Because of
this, my Dad ended up with an amazing amount of unusable military
surplus, things like gas-masks and vehicle parts that were worthless
in the civilian world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
from time to time, we'd get weapons, too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ,
he never bought a pile of crap and ended up with a crate full of
M-16's or a Shrike missile, the military was usually careful enough
to keep THAT from happening. But from time to time we <i>did</i> end
up with stuff we weren't supposed to have. Once day I opened a crate
marked "heater assembly" and found it full of smoke grenades. My Dad
found a steel ammo box full of blank M-60 rounds once. And even
though these instances were a rarity, the Army had a very strict
policy toward scrap dealers who found such things: You had to give
them back. No two ways about it. Before even being allowed to place a
bid, dealers at an auction were required to sign several forms, one
of which stated that they'd return any "explosive, ordnance, fuse,
detonator, or other chemically viable part or assembly of a weapons
system." I remember that paragraph well, since it's the only part of
the Army red tape that ever directly pertained to me. The penalties
for non-compliance outlined at the end of the paragraph sounded
pretty scary (five-figure fines, possible imprisonment, etc), and
were enough to make my Dad return the crate of smoke grenades, but
not the blank ammo. These were judged to be too trivial to warrant a
drive to the base, and my Dad ended up keeping them draped over a
file cabinet in his office, as a decoration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
course I'm telling you this because it's how I managed to get hold of
the JATO bottle we used for our rocket car. Actually there were four
of them, each in a long, hay-filled crate with "BARREL ASSEMBLY"
stenciled on the side. One day I went out to the base to pick up a
load of junk my Dad had bought at the auction, and while we were
going through the stuff back at the yard, I spotted the crates and
took a look. And even though I didn't know what the hell it was at
first glance, I knew it wasn't a barrel for <i>anything</i>. The JATO
bottle was a round metal cylinder about four feet long, and less than
a foot in diameter. At first I thought it was a gas cylinder of some
sort, but written on the side in red paint were the words "M-23 JET
ASSIST UNIT". And rather than the sort of valve assembly you'd see on
a gas cylinder, the end of the bottle had an inverted funnel shape to
it, with a rubber plug at the lowest point. It was obviously a rocket
of some sort. And judging from the weight (it took two people to even
budge the things) they were still full of something.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once I
figured out what they were, I decided I had to call Jimmy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
and I met in the third grade (or thereabouts), and were best friends
for most of our growing-up. His family lived just down the street,
and his father ran an auto body shop in town. On more than one
occasion Jimmy's Dad and my own traded parts or services, and our
families were pretty close. But while I went to work for my father
after graduating high school, Jimmy went to college to study
mechanical engineering. He had a natural talent for figuring out
things in the physical world, but was never much good at putting them
into practice. He could design and visualize, but when it came to
hands-on applications, he just wasn't very talented.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless,
he was the first person I showed the JATO bottles to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually,
I didn't show them to anyone right away. The campus where Jimmy took
classes was almost 150 miles away, so he spent his weekdays in a
rented room and only came home on the weekends. I found the JATO's on
a Wednesday, which meant I had three days before I could tell Jimmy
about them. More than enough time for me to cook up the idea of the
Rocket Car. As a matter of fact, as soon as I realized what that dull
metal cylinder represented, I thought about attaching it to a car and
taking a jet-propelled ride. I spent the rest of Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday planning how it could be done. The principle certainly
seemed simple enough. Nail the rocket onto one of the junkers in my
Dad's field, point it down a straight stretch of road, and light the
mother up. Sure there'd be minor details to be worked out, but the
basic idea was fairly straightforward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I
can say is thank God I consulted with Jimmy before actually doing
anything. If it wasn't for his intervention, I'd have probably ended
up a damp spot on a highway somewhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
came over to the house on Saturday morning, we drove to the yard, and
I showed him the rocket. He immediately knew what it was, or at least
what it seemed to be. A solid fuel rocket, the kind they'd used in
Vietnam to give cargo planes a kick in the ass when they needed to
take off from short runways. Very simple, very straightforward. Also
very dangerous. I described the idea of the Rocket Car to him, and at
first he was pretty enthusiastic. But after thinking the whole thing
over for awhile, he not only lost his enthusiasm, but made me promise
I wouldn't actually <i>do</i> anything with the JATO until he had
time to check a few things out. I agreed, mainly because I knew I'd
need Jimmy's help if I was ever going to make the Rocket Car work.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
talked about design possibilities for the rest of the weekend, and
when Jimmy went back to campus, I stashed the JATO's in the back of a
wasted milk truck rusting in the field. When Jimmy came back the
following weekend, we sat down at his kitchen table and he explained
<i>precisely</i> why the rocket car wouldn't work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was
a sobering (and depressing) lecture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
main problem was control. Jimmy explained that the JATO bottle would
produce something like 2,500 pounds of thrust (albeit for a very
short time), which sounded like more than enough to ensure a fun
ride. Unfortunately, this huge amount of thrust would not only be
unstoppable once it was started, it would probably have to be applied
to a point on the car that wasn't designed to handle such a such a
force. Under normal circumstances, a car gets its forward thrust
from the back axle, by way of tires against the pavement. Which means
that a normal car will never exceed a certain amount of thrust due to
the fact that the tires <i>have</i> to touch the pavement to move the
car forward. Jimmy described the whole thing using top-fuel dragsters
as an example. When the driver hits the gas, the back end of the car
tries to lift into the air due to the sudden force applied to the
rear axle. But as soon as the ass end starts to lift, the tires lose
traction, and the thrust decreases. The back end drops, thrust is
restored, and the process starts all over again. So a car of a given
weight using driven wheels can only get so much forward thrust. The
limiting factors are the weight, the distribution of the weight, size
of the tires, and torque applied to the wheels. The fact that a car
uses driven wheels creates a self-damping system that ensures the
wheels will stay on the ground (at least most of the time). The only
reason dragsters and funny cars pop wheelies is that they use
oversized tires that screw up the relationship between torque and
traction. Unfortunately, a rocket car has no such restraints. A
massive amount of thrust is suddenly being applied to a point on the
car that wasn't designed to handle it, and there's no telling what
happens next. Maybe the front end lifts off the ground. Maybe the
rear. Maybe the ass end would slew around sideways. The only thing
that was certain was that the car would <i>not</i> go in a straight
line, and would continue to not go in a straight line at a
<i>very</i> high rate of speed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally
I asked how Craig Breedlove managed to drive the Spirit of America at
600+ miles an hour, but I knew the answer before I even spit the
question out. He hired a team of aerospace engineers and rocket
scientists to design a car that was <i>built</i> to have a jet engine
sticking out its ass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
hearing this, Jimmy didn't even have to outline the rest of the
reasons why my idea wouldn't work, but he did anyway. There was also
the fact that store-bought tires couldn't handle the sort of
acceleration a rocket would provide, which was why all land-speed
record cars used custom-made, solid-rubber tires. Simply
<i>spinning</i> a regular tire at rocket-car speeds would probably
create enough centrifugal force to tear it right off the rim. And if
that wasn't enough, there was the problem of stopping the thing once
it got rolling. And structural stress. And so on and so on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By
this time I'd pretty much decided that the whole idea was stupid and
suicidal, which was why I was amazed when Jimmy proceeded to tell me
exactly how the rocket car <i>could</i> work.</p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">TRAIN OF THOUGHT</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
thing that remains constant in every re-telling of the Rocket Car
legend is that it reportedly took place somewhere in the southwest
United States. I've heard versions stating that the whole thing
happened in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, western Texas and
southwestern California, and in each case, the location seemed to be
a critical part of the plot. Which makes sense, considering the
premise that the story is based on. The Rocket Car would have to be
launched on a fairly long, flat stretch of road, away from prying
eyes. The Mojave is an ideal place to find such a road, as anyone
who's ever driven across the desert will tell you. The Darwin Award
version specifies Arizona, which is covered with roads that would be
ideal for the event described in the story. But one thing that
strikes me as incredibly silly about this version is the fact that
the test pilot chose to test his vehicle on a road with a
<i>curve</i> in it. The story specifies that the cliff where the car
impacted was at the "apex of a curve", and that the test pilot ran
under JATO power for 2.4 miles before hitting the turn and becoming
airborne.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
suggests a pretty obvious question: If you were going to test drive a
rocket-powered car, what sort of road would <i>you</i> pick for the
ride? Would you choose a section of highway less than three miles
from a turn in the road that overlooked a canyon?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
don't think I would.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even
if Jimmy hadn't been around to talk sense into me and I <i>had</i>
attempted to drive the rocket car, I'm sure I could've found a
stretch of highway that didn't include a hairpin turn. The desert
contains thousands of miles of highways and dirt roads, and it
would've been much harder to find the kind of road in the Darwin
story than to find a nice level straightaway. On the other hand, when
Wile E. Coyote lights the big skyrocket tied to <i>his</i> jalopy, he
<i>always</i> seems to be near an unexpected turn. I guess whoever
wrote the Darwin story must have assumed this was standard procedure.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately,
highways aren't the only long, straight thoroughfares through the
desert. After Jimmy was through demolishing my plans to build the
Rocket Car, he pointed out that the control problem could easily be
overcome if the car was actually a rocket <i>sled</i>, running on
rails rather than asphalt. Mounting the rocket on a railroad car
would not only solve the problems of control and traction, but if an
<i>abandoned</i> stretch of track was used, traffic wouldn't even be
an issue. And the Mojave is covered with abandoned railroad track,
most of it the old-fashioned narrow-gauge kind used for mining trains
near the turn of the century. I knew of at least three such pieces of
track within five miles of town. Finding a railroad car that would
actually run on the old-fashioned track was a whole nother story, but
by the time Jimmy finished explaining his idea, I already had a plan
in mind to deal with that part of the equation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
following morning I found myself bouncing across the desert in a
battered four-wheel drive pickup with the remaining two members of
Team Rocket Car (my tongue is firmly in cheek when I use <i>that</i>
term), Sal and Beck. Beck and I were almost as close as Jimmy and I
when we were kids, but Beck had a "wild streak" that caused most of
the trouble we got into from time to time. During high school his
"wild streak" got out of control, Beck turned into "one of those
dope-smoking degenerates" (Mom's preferred term) and he dropped out a
year shy of graduation. Sal was Beck's junior brother, junior not
only by calendar-count but by any sort of I.Q. measurement. Sal
wasn't retarded or anything, but people tended to use phrases like
"not too swift" and "a few bricks short of a load", a lot more often
than usual when he was around. Just like "dope smoking degenerate"
tended to pop up in conversations that involved Beck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay,
so they weren't exactly Nobel Prize laureates, but I didn't have much
choice in my selection of assistants. I needed their truck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
truck actually belonged to Beck's father, who used it in the
performance of his job. Whatever <i>that</i> was. Nobody knew for
sure what Beck's Dad did for a living but the truck was ugly and
battered, sat on huge mud-grabber tires, and came with a massive 454
engine. Beck's father would drive the thing out of town occasionally,
sometimes staying gone for days at a time. When he returned, the
truck always looked as if it had spent the entire time driving around
in the desert. If Beck knew what his father did for a living, he
never said. But Jimmy and I figured the man used his pickup for
transporting something (ahem) back and forth from remote desert
locations. Contraband vegetation arriving at an isolated airstrip was
one possibility, and people desperate to become American citizens
without a lot of government interference was another. The only
relevant fact is that the truck was very good for cruising the
desert, which is why we used it to visit an abandoned silver mine a
few miles from town that morning. The mine had been out of commission
and the entrance boarded over for as long as any of us could
remember, but at least a few brave kids had explored the interior of
the shaft. Everyone knew there was nothing of value left in the mine,
with the exception of some ancient equipment that was worthless, even
as scrap. Worthless to most people, anyway. That's because very few
people went into the mine <i>looking</i> for old mining equipment.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
did. And we found some, too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually,
Beck himself was one of the juvenile delinquents who'd poked around
in the mine years earlier, so he knew just what to expect when we
pried off the old wooden planks covering the entrance. Less than a
dozen feet into the shaft was a train of ancient bucket-cars, the
tiny railcars used to haul ore out of the mine while it was in use.
Probably parked so close to the entrance to discourage people from
going any further. I wasn't too thrilled about entering a man-made
tunnel that could cave in at any moment, but I could see from my
flashlight beam that the "train" only consisted of three bucket-cars
linked together. And despite the fact that they'd probably been
parked for forty years or more, they seemed to be in reasonably good
condition. Shit lasts forever in the desert, it really does. Beck
dragged a towchain into the mine, looped it around the hitch on the
last car, then used the pickup to drag the whole line of cars closer
to the entrance. When the cars were nearly clear of the overhang, I
went inside and used a five-pound pony-sledge to bash the connection
on the last car until it came free. When Beck threw the pickup into
gear and dragged the first two cars clear of the mine, and the metal
wheels screeched so loud I thought it would bring the shaft down on
my head. Of course the wheels were frozen with rust, but they were
far from destroyed. The first thing we did when we got the bucket
cars into the light of day was turn them upside-down, then slop
grease onto the axles. After a few well-placed whacks with the
sledge, we got the wheels to turn. A few more whacks, and we had them
turning freely enough to push the bucket-cars up a ramp and into the
back of the pickup. Once the bucket cars were loaded, we replaced the
boards over the mine entrance, then took the cars back to the
scrapyard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Rocket Car was off to a fine start.</p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">LUXURY AT THE SPEED OF SOUND</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
aspect of the Rocket Car legend that always tickles me is that no
matter how much the story varies, the make, model and year of the car
is <i>always</i> specified. Sure this is a nice detail to have on
hand, but considering the details left <i>out</i> of the description,
it looks... sorta silly. In the Darwin Award version, there's no
mention of which highway the car was on, or even whereabouts in
Arizona the story took place. And Arizona is a pretty big place.
There's also no mention of any investigation that took place
afterwards. But despite all these oversights, the story <i>did
</i>specify that the car was a 1967 Chevy Impala. I think the reason
this detail is always supplied is because it's critical to make the
listener think the test pilot at least <i>looked</i> cool when he
flew into the cliff. You'll never hear someone tell a story about a
guy in a rocket-powered K-car or a Volkswagen Beetle. It has to be a
car that <i>deserves</i> to have a rocket attached to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
case of our Rocket Car, we gave some serious thought to not even
using a car body. As soon as we got back to the scrapyard, Beck
wanted to weld one of the JATO's to a bucket car, stick the car on a
track, and light the rocket. He was doubtless the craziest member of
Team Rocket Car, and if I'd been willing to go along with his idea, I
have no doubt he'd have climbed in and lit the fuse himself.
Fortunately, they were <i>my</i> JATOs, so I had veto power over all
the dumb ideas. Or at least the <i>real</i> dumb ones. Of course
sticking a JATO on a bucket car was out of the question, but building
a simple platform on a bucket-car base with a car seat bolted onto it
sounded like the easiest way to build a rocket sled. Actually, this
is pretty much what the NASA rocket sleds looked like. But this
arrangement would mean that each run would be limited to a single
passenger, and I only had four JATO's. When Jimmy and I discussed the
details of the project, he seemed pretty confident that the thrust
from the rocket would be enough to push a four-passenger car at a
reasonable speed. And if we used a car body, we'd have a windshield,
doors, and some degree of protection if anything went wrong. Granted,
a car body wouldn't do us much good if we hit something (like a
canyon wall) at jet-fighter speed, but it was better than wiping out
in a director's chair at 300 miles per hour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite
Beck's impatience, I got started building the Rocket Car the next
day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
car wasn't a 1967 Chevy Impala, but a 1959 Chevy Impala. A bone-white
Impala, with a red interior. I know how bizarre that sounds, but once
a story starts to mutate into a legend, there's no telling which
parts of the truth will stick. Obviously the Chevy Impala part made
the cut.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
didn't choose the `59 Impala for its aerodynamics or structural
qualities, but because one was available. My father happened to have
one, resting on cinderblocks, in a forgotten corner of his lot.
Engine, transmission and wheels were all missing, sold to Jimmy's
father at some point. The only reason this car was otherwise intact
was that Chevrolet only used the 1959 style for a single year, which
meant the body parts would only be usable on another 1959 Impala.
This particular car was obscure enough so that once the mechanical
parts were stripped, it was pretty much useless. And this is why what
was left of my Dad's `59 Impala was left to decay in a field.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately,
the leftovers were all that we needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting
the bodies from the bucket cars was a chore, but not as bad as I
expected. The thin metal of the buckets was rusted to tatters in
spots, so burning through it was fairly easy. But despite this, I
still used almost an entire tank of oxy getting the bodies cut away
from the bases, and I knew my Dad would be suspicious when he found
I'd used all the oxygen in an almost- full tank. Luckily, Jimmy was
able to help out in that department. When I told him about my
predicament the following weekend, he simply took my empty oxygen
cylinder and swapped it with one of the dozen or so his Dad kept on
hand at his body shop. My father might notice if a brand new tank of
oxygen were suddenly empty, but Jimmy's Dad's shop used so much gas
he'd never know the difference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attaching
the cut-away rail car bases to the Chevy frame was pretty easy too.
Jimmy stressed the importance of getting the two sets of wheels
precisely aligned, but it wasn't that hard. The old Chevy frame had
plenty of places for bolts and welds, so picking spots where the
wheels would line up was a snap. And since the Impala was already up
on blocks, it was no problem to slide the wheel frames underneath and
lift them into place with a floor jack, then weld away. I'm sure that
these days my students would laugh like hell at the thought of me
laying underneath a car with an oxyacetylene torch in my hand, but
the fact is, I learned how to draw a bead and cut metal when I was 14
or 15 years old. Growing up around a scrapyard <i>did</i> have
certain advantages, and learning how to work with a torch was one of
them. So aligning the wheel frames and welding them to the car was a
fairly straightforward process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
propulsion unit (hah!) consisted of a five-foot length of steel water
pipe, welded to both the rear bucket car <i>and</i> the Chevy's
frame. This might sound like overkill, but at the time I had no idea
how much thrust to expect from the JATO bottle, so it seemed best to
err on the side of caution. I plugged the end of the pipe facing the
front of the car with a slug of scrap steel and welded it into place,
and even cut the center out of a threaded cap to screw onto the
exhaust end to hold the JATO bottle securely once it was installed.
The end-cap seemed like a good idea while I was doing it, but Jimmy
laughed like hell when he came in the following weekend and saw my
handiwork. He pointed at the steel cap, and said "That rocket is
gonna be pushing against the car hard enough to make it fly like a
bullet, and you're afraid it'll fall out the BACK end?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
can I say? This is one of the reasons Jimmy was doing all the
brainwork.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately,
his critique wasn't only limited to the job I did on the "propulsion
unit". He also asked how I planned to stop the thing once the ride
was over, and I had to admit that I didn't have the slightest idea.

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">TOUGH BRAKES</font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
Darwin version of the Rocket Car tale, the car burned out its brakes
instantly, and was eventually stopped by a cliff face. We hoped to
come up with a somewhat more elegant braking system, and we did. But
not without considerable brainwork.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
night Jimmy inspected my work on the Chevy, all four members of Team
Rocket Car gathered at a neighborhood bar to discuss the considerable
problem of stopping the car once it was moving. When I started
putting the car together, I assumed Jimmy would have some idea what
we'd do. But as it turned out, he was just as clueless as the rest of
us. So we gathered at the bar in the hope that <i>one</i> of us could
come up with a workable idea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
course the lack of any way to stop the Rocket Car was considered a
very minor point with Beck. He was perfectly willing to haul the car
out to a long stretch of empty track, get in, fire it up, and hope he
slowed down before he ran out of track. In his eyes, worrying about
something as trivial as brakes was a sign of cowardice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I
said, he was out of his fucking mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately,
Beck didn't have much say about the situation, so we decided that we
wouldn't launch the car until we had <i>some</i> sort of braking
mechanism to slow it down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
most popular idea was, naturally, a drogue chute. The Spirit of
America used one, as did a few types of fighter planes, top fuel
dragsters, etc. But like the optimal solutions to most of our
problems, the question was where to <i>find</i> one. Nobody had any
idea how to go about getting a parachute. Nobody except for me, that
is. My father actually had six Army surplus parachutes sitting in a
storage shed near the office at the scrapyard, the spoils of
particularly good auction years before. Five of them were standard
personnel chutes, and one was a massive cargo-drop canopy. But Dad
also <i>knew</i> he had six of them. He'd started out with a dozen,
and occasionally sold one to a skydiver or army/navy store. A good
surplus parachute was worth upwards of $200. There was no telling
what the cargo chute would be worth to the right buyer. But if one
were to turn up missing, Dad would certainly notice. Of course we
might have gotten away with using a parachute, then returning it once
we were finished with it, but even this presented problems. It might
work okay for the <i>first</i> ride, but how about the second? I
certainly knew nothing about parachute rigging. All I was sure of was
that there was a <i>lot</i> of cloth that had to be stuffed into a
very small pack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides,
I'd already stuck my neck out pretty far for the sake of the Rocket
Car, and I didn't want to stick it out any further. So I kept the
existence of Dad's parachutes to myself, and hoped someone else would
come up with an alternate plan.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using
a retro-rocket was discussed briefly, but it only took Jimmy a minute
to punch <i>that</i> idea full of holes. Even though rigging a retro
would mean nothing more than sticking a second JATO on the front of
the car to oppose the one in the rear, it would mean a maximum of two
rides before we ran out of JATO's. This much was obvious. What wasn't
obvious was the physics of the whole thing, which Jimmy was happy to
explain. Firing the first rocket would provide a huge forward thrust
for a very short time, but a retro rocket would produce an
<i>identical</i> thrust (if we were lucky) in the opposite direction,
for the same duration. Which would mean the only way to bring the car
to a dead stop would be to fire the retro as soon as the thrust
rocket burned out. That would result in a 0-to-300 acceleration in
seconds, followed by a 300-to-0 <i>de</i>celeration in the same
amount of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't
sound like much fun, does it?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if
the retro was fired a little too late, it could easily result in the
whole rig traveling <i>backwards</i>. Possibly at a high rate of
speed. Or even worse, the retro might be a dud. Or the ignition
system might not work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless
to say, we shitcanned the retro-rocket idea in a hurry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal
suggested outfitting the car with a huge anchor, one that could be
heaved out the window at the critical moment. The rest of us
suggested that Sal shut the fuck up and get us another round of
beers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
brought up one idea I'd been toying with, stretching a cable across
the track and fitting the Rocket Car with a tailhook to slow it down.
Why not? After all, aircraft carriers had been using this system to
stop incoming planes for years, and it seemed to work just fine. But
before I could explain the idea, Beck started laughing his ass off,
then asked if I wanted to use a rubber inner-tube to catch the car,
or just tie a rope between two fence-posts. And I clearly remember
how much this pissed me off. Here was a guy willing to strap a
military rocket onto his back and sit in a rusty rail-car while
someone lit the fuse, but he was laughing at <i>my</i> ideas.
Unfortunately, he <i>did</i> have a point. It wasn't until years
later that I found out how aircraft carriers absorbed the shock of a
plane catching an arresting wire (it involves huge pistons moving
through cylinders of hydraulic fluid), but I knew that rigging a
similar system would be next to impossible. Putting a tailhook on the
car and catching an arresting wire was simple. But it sure as hell
couldn't be stationary wire. There would have to be some system to
absorb the impact of a car moving at high speeds, and we couldn't
come up with anything. We went through a slew of ideas for mechanical
systems, but I rejected them all because they were either too
complicated, too expensive, or too impractical.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
pointed out that rocket sleds usually ended up in a pool of water,
which both acted as a brake and cooled the whole contraption down.
Beck pointed out that all the narrow-gauge railroad tracks
<i>he'd</i> ever seen were in the middle of the desert, where pools
of water were pretty tough to come by.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall,
we ended up batting exactly zero for the evening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
remember that I was pretty damned depressed when Jimmy and I left the
bar that night, despite the fact that I was pretty drunk. Considering
the progress I'd made on the rocket car up to that point, I figured
that a braking system would be a minor point. Surely if we put all
three of our heads together (well, 3-1/2, counting Sal) we could come
up with <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it
hadn't happened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at
least it hadn't happened while we were all sitting at the bar. Jimmy
tried to blow some optimistic sunshine up my ass while we walked up
the street toward our houses, saying that one of us might be able to
come up with something later, once we were all sober. I didn't
consider it likely. Beck and Sal seemed to think better when they
were drunk, and they were both pretty shitfaced when we left them. If
they hadn't come up with anything at the bar, chances are they never
would. And Jimmy and I weren't having any brainstorms drunk <i>or</i>
sober.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,
there's no telling how Sal and Beck spent the rest of their evening,
but the next morning my Dad woke me up by pounding on my bedroom
door. When I finally peeled my eyes open, he asked me who was
delivering my car parts in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had
no idea what he was talking about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part
of my incomprehension was from a hangover, but even if I'd spent the
previous night drinking Kool Aid, I would've been pretty confused. So
he led me out to the front porch and pointed to a bundle of four
thick metal rods, tied together with twine, laying on the porch
swing. When I looked closer, I saw that they were actually a set of
heavy-duty air-adjustable car shock absorbers. Jammed under the twine
was a note written in what looked like crayon on a crumpled paper
bag.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
said this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problum
solved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call
me later</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major
Tom</p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">HEAT OF THE MOMENTUM</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
stared at the note for quite awhile, trying to figure out what it
meant. At first I figured Jimmy must have left the bundle of shocks,
since his father stocked such things at his body shop. But there was
no way a college student like Jimmy would misspell a common word like
"problem", drunk or sober. And the fact that most of the words were
spelled <i><font color="#000000">correctly</font></i> pretty much
eliminated Sal. Which meant that the shock-absorber care package must
have been Beck's doing, and as soon as I realized this, I hustled the
bundle into the house and stashed it in my room. Obviously Beck's
creative juices hadn't <i>really</i> started flowing until Jimmy and
I left the previous night, and he'd eventually come up with some sort
of solution to the braking problem. It also seemed that he had enough
confidence in his idea to act on it. At the time I had no idea what
sort of solution Beck could've come up with for our "problum", I just
hoped it turned out to be as sensible in the light of day as it
seemed when Beck came up with it the night before. The bundle of
shocks I stuck under my bed were relatively new, but covered with
dust and road-grime. They obviously hadn't come from an all-night
auto parts store. I guessed that Beck had been struck with a burst of
twisted inspiration after Jimmy and I left, then spent the rest of
the night staggering around town with his brother, a bumper jack, and
a crescent wrench. Looking for donor to contribute some hardware to
our cause. It seemed as if they'd found one, too. And if someone was
going to wake up that morning to a car that was mysteriously missing
all four shock absorbers, I hoped like hell Beck's plan was worth it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I
never actually <i>asked</i> Beck where the shocks came from, and he
never volunteered the information. I didn't consider it critical to
the mission.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did,
however, call him later in the day to ask what I was supposed to
<i>do</i> with the shocks. His first suggestion was that I stick them
up my ass. I&nbsp;assumed that he was just in a bad mood from a
hangover, since there was no way an assfull of shock absorbers would
help to slow a fast-moving Rocket Car. So I kept interrogating him
until he finally remembered the details of his Grand Plan, and agreed
to meet me at the scrapyard later on. When he finally showed up at
the gates to the yard he looked like hammered shit, but I expected as
much. Go spend a night getting drunk and stealing auto parts and see
how <i>you</i> feel the next day. But he was also reasonably
coherent, and described his idea while we walked out to the weedy
corner of the field where the Rocket Car was still perched on
cinderblocks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I
have to admit, it was good. Real good. Better than anything we'd
figured out up to that point, anyway. But the best part (to me,
anyway) was that it didn't involve me stealing anything else that my
father might notice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck's
idea was simple, elegant, and easy to put into practice. I'd install
the air shocks on the Rocket Car normally, just as if the car would
be riding on pavement instead of rails. But I'd also bolt a pair of
wooden beams onto the belly of the car, runners that were placed
exactly between the front <img src="./cdc-0363_files/fig2.jpg" width="373" height="540" align="left">and rear train wheels. Each runner would be thick enough
to reach almost all the way down to the tracks, and the bottom would
be covered with rubber cut from old tires. The effect would be that
the car would roll freely while the air shocks were inflated, with
the twin runners suspended inches above the steel tracks. When it was
time to stop the car, the pilot would activate a release valve which
would dump the air from all four shock absorbers simultaneously. The
car would drop until its entire weight was resting on the runners,
which would be pressing into the railroad tracks. This would provide
two brake shoes three feet long, pushed against the track under the
weight of the car's body, providing a <i>huge</i> amount of
stopping-power. And since the wheel flanges would also still be
firmly on the tracks, the car would remain traveling in a straight
line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
Beck finished explaining his idea, I stood there with my mouth
hanging open. Actually we <i>both</i> stood there with our mouths
open, but while my jaw was flopping due to surprise, Beck's was
caused by a powerful hangover that was still affecting his motor
control. I must admit, though, I was pretty impressed with his
thinking. We'd talked about dozens of ways to stop the rocket car the
previous evening, but nothing that even came <i>close</i> to Beck's
plan. It was simple to build, easy to install, and stood a fair
chance of working. I knew that sooner or later I'd have to talk to
Jimmy about the whole thing, but that didn't stop me from getting to
work installing the air shocks on the Chevy as soon as Beck slouched
out of the scrapyard and went home.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
worked on the car for the rest of the afternoon, wanting to get as
much done as I could on a Sunday, while the yard was closed. By the
end of the day, I had the shocks installed on the car and a pair of
three-foot-long runners made from sections of 2 x 4 bolted together
to make them thick enough to reach the rails. All that was left to do
was bolt the runners to the car frame and arrange the air hoses for
the shock absorbers, and the car would be ready to test. It was THEN
that I finally called Jimmy and asked him to come down to the yard.
Talking to him sooner would've been the sensible thing to do, but I
didn't want to take a chance that he'd come up with some laughably
obvious reason the brake-runner system wouldn't work. At the time, my
thinking on the subject was pretty clear: There were only two ways
were going to be able to stop the Rocket Car, either by using a
drogue chute or by Beck's braking system. And although I wasn't too
keen on the idea of taking one of my Dad's parachutes, I'd do it if
it was the only way to get the Rocket Car to work. But even if we
<i>did</i> use a drogue chute, the car would need an additional
braking system anyway. A parachute will <i>slow</i> a car, but it
won't <i>stop</i> it. You still need regular brakes for that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
way I figured it, we'd need Beck's idea no matter what happened. So I
decided to show Jimmy the braking system I was building and see what
he thought. If he pointed out some reason why it was completely
foolish, I'd show him Dad's parachute collection, then tell him that
the brake runners were the <i>standby </i>system, and we were
actually going to use a parachute to slow the car to reasonable
speed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It not
only sounded reasonable, but it kept me from looking like a total
asshole.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my
planning was unnecessary, though. When Jimmy heard me describe the
rail-braking system and saw what I'd done to the car so far, he was
<i>very</i> impressed. I think he was also a little pissed off that
Beck had come up with the idea, and not him. But here's a thought
that never occurred to me back in 1978, and to be honest, I'm glad it
didn't: We never really had any proof that it was <i>Beck</i> who
came up with the idea. For all we know, it was <i>Sal</i> who dreamed
up the notion of using runners to stop the car. Yes, yes, I know,
it's a ridiculous thought. Like having your pet hamster wake up one
morning with a revolutionary process for splitting atoms. After all,
we're talking about the guy who wanted the pilot of the Rocket Car to
hoist a goddamned <i>anchor</i> out the window to slow down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still,
you never know. And Jimmy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry I even
brought it up now. I know you'll lose some sleep over it. But I
couldn't resist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,
Jimmy <i>did</i> give the braking system his stamp of approval, and I
never had to admit that Dad had a bunch of parachutes stashed in the
shed. The only reservation Jimmy had about the system was one that
should've been obvious to me from the start: heat. If the car were
traveling as fast as we expected it to, rubber-coated planks pressing
against metal rails would probably get hotter than hell. On the other
hand, this <i>was</i> basically the same system used by every car on
the road, as well as racing cars. Drum and disc brakes are
essentially nothing more than pads or shoes pressing against moving
pieces of steel to stop the car. The only difference between their
system and ours was that standard brakes pressed brake pads against
steel that was spinning, while ours used steel moving in a straight
line. And even though our car would be traveling a lot faster than
most, we had much more overall braking surface. So Jimmy and I talked
about ways to cool the runners for awhile, just in case heat buildup
turned out to be a real problem. Actually, I think Jimmy might have
made the heat problem sound worse than it really was, just so Beck
wouldn't get ALL the credit for solving the brake problem. But to
give credit where it's due, we <i>did</i> wind up with a heat
problem, so whatever Jimmy's motivations might have been, it's a good
thing I listened to him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
again, if I'd ignored him, I doubt it would've changed the final
outcome too much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
the conceptual details taken care of, all that was left was
construction. Even though the braking and brake-cooling systems were
the hardest part of the car to fabricate, it didn't take long to get
them built and installed. Bolting the runners to the car frame was
quick work, and even though it took a little doing to get the
air-dump valve connected to all four shock absorbers, I had plenty of
materials to work with laying around the scrap yard. After removing
the valve stems from the air inlets to the shocks, I attached
sections of air-compressor hose to the valves themselves. The other
ends of the hoses ran to an air valve that started life as the
door-opening lever on a city bus. With the lever in the "open"
position, all four shocks could be inflated from a single air inlet
near the dump lever. Once the shocks were pressurized, releasing the
lever kept them inflated until the lever was pushed again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
first tested the air-valve system on Tuesday afternoon, and when I
saw that it worked the way it was supposed to, I immediately called
Beck. He came to the yard with Sal, and the three of us took turns
raising and lowering the car for almost an hour before the novelty
wore off. Despite the fact that it wasn't very exciting to watch,
there was something distinctly satisfying about seeing the system
work the way it was supposed to. Of course Beck was more anxious to
"take the car for a spin" than ever, and he actually got a little
pissed off when I pointed out that we weren't out of the woods yet.
There was still a heat problem to deal with, but this detail didn't
cut much ice with Beck. He was positive that it wouldn't be a
problem, which meant that our next step was to take the Chevy out and
light the rocket. So rather than dwell on the heat problem, I said
"Haul it out <i>WHERE</i>, and light the rocket with <i>WHAT</i>?"
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
took the wind out of his sails in a hurry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See,
we still hadn't considered how we were going to ignite the JATO, but
to be honest, this wasn't a major sticking point. There was a rubber
plug in the end of the exhaust nozzle of the rocket I'd inspected,
and it seemed logical to assume that some sort of igniter plugged
into the hole. Probably an electrical fuse, something along the lines
of the igniters used for model rockets. Whatever fueled the rocket
(ammonium perchlorate, I later found out) was no doubt highly
flammable, and shouldn't be too tough to ignite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I
knew I could come up with something better than a fuse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A much
bigger problem was the launch site. Beck got sulky and petulant when
I pointed out that we had no idea where we'd actually run the car,
but he didn't argue too much. Even if I agreed to hoist the car onto
Dad's flatbed right then and there and drive around searching for a
spot to use, I'm sure Beck would've realized how dumb the idea was
before we even got out of the yard. So I put Beck in charge of
finding a suitable launch site, which I'd have done even if he wasn't
being a royal pain in the ass and keeping me from my work. His Dad's
four-wheel drive was the perfect vehicle for location-scouting, and
he and Sal were more familiar with the surrounding desert than anyone
I knew. Beck and Sal headed for the gates deep in conversation, and I
got back to work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
brake-cooling system I ended up building was pretty cheesy, I'll be
the first to admit that. But since we weren't even sure it was
necessary, I didn't want to spend a lot of time messing with it. I
ran a length of garden hose along each wooden runner, near the point
where the runner was attached to the car. Took the ends near the
front of each runner, and led them into the empty engine compartment.
I tied off the ends under the car, then punched holes along the
sections near the runners with an awl. Water entering the ends in the
engine compartment would leak out through the perforations, soaking
the runners and pads.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told
you it was pretty cheesy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
only part of the cooling arrangement that even came <i>close</i> to
sophistication was the result of a brainstorm that came to me while I
was strapping a five-gallon jerry can under the hood of the Rocket
Car. I started putting the sprinkler system together with the idea
that we'd simply open a valve before launch, letting water leak out
of the hoses and onto the runners for the duration of the run. But
while I was attaching the jerry can, a better method occurred to me.
Instead of attaching the garden hoses to a valve, I drilled a pair of
holes directly into the top of the jerry can, and fed the hoses
through the holes. Then I drilled a third, smaller hole, and
connected another hose from the jerry can to the air-dump handle for
the shock absorbers. I sealed all the hose connections with massive
amounts of rubber cement, then called it quits for the day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
word from Beck or Sal that night, so I assumed finding a launch site
wasn't as easy as they'd thought it would be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I
checked the Rocket Car the next day, the rubber cement sealant had
dried to the consistency of a hockey puck, so I tested the entire
system. I filled the air shocks from Dad's portable compressor, then
closed the dump valve. Filled the jerry can with water, and screwed
the top down tight. Said a quick prayer, and hit the dump-valve
lever. There was a slight hiss as the air rushed out of the shocks,
through the dump valve. But instead of being vented into the open,
the last air-hose I'd installed directed the escaping air <i>into</i>
the jerry can full of water under the hood, forcing water <i>out</i>
through the sprinkler hoses. When I checked under the car there was
an impressive puddle, and water was still jetting out of the holes in
the garden hoses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
thrilled beyond words.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
when Jimmy saw the whole system in action a few days later, he said
he was "..really impressed with my application of Bernoulli's
Principle." Hell, I didn't even know that the Italians <i>built</i>
rocket cars.</p>

</center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
I go on, I think I should take a minute to explain why this whole
story is getting so lengthy. Actually, my wife says I should issue a
formal apology for inflicting such a long-winded pile of shit on
anyone who reads this. And I halfway agree with her. But I want to
make you aware of one thing: I did <i>not</i> plan it this way. When
I decided to write down the story of the Rocket Car, I figured it
would take all of two pages, maybe three. Four at the outside. That's
because I was working from a set of 20-year-old recollections, and a
lot of the details were missing. I didn't realize that once I started
dredging up these old memories, all <i>sorts</i> of bits and pieces
would start to fill themselves in, whether I wanted them to or not.
Four pages became five, then six, etc. etc. I originally planned to
have the whole thing done by the beginning of April, so that it would
be ready to go on the 20th anniversary of the first (and last) run of
our Rocket Car, but April came and went, and I was still hunting and
pecking. So did May, then June.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing
I can do about it now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides
the miscellaneous details that came flooding back when I started to
write this story down, the technical details of the whole project
turned out to be more involved than I remembered when I started
writing. When I began, I remembered a simple 1-2-3 process that took
place over the course of a few weeks, and seemed fairly simple. But
as the story progressed, I realized I had to supply a <i>lot</i> more
detail than I originally intended, just to keep it from sounding
completely stupid. And I'm still not sure I've accomplished the
not-sounding-stupid part. Even though the project was executed one
step at a time, it had a goofy, ill-planned, Li'l Rascals feel to it,
and no amount of explaining is going to change that. Because
basically it WAS a Li'l Rascals undertaking. The only thing missing
was a sign saying "He-Man Rocket Kar Klub" over a treehouse door. But
I'm not going to lie about the facts or try to make the whole thing
sound less silly than it actually was. If someone had been hurt or
killed, or even we'd been caught trying to run a homemade rocket car
through the desert, I'm sure we'd all have ended up in the pokey.
Even if a judge were willing to overlook the instances of theft and
trespassing and illegal possession of military fireworks, we'd have
probably been charged with <i>something</i>, just on general
principal. Conspiracy To Commit Flagrant Stupidity, maybe. If Beck
had gotten his way, a charge of attempted suicide would've been a
sure thing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
nothing like this ever happened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having
said that, I'd now like to issue a formal apology for inflicting such
a long-winded pile of shit on you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry
about that. &nbsp;It won't happen again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
you go, Lily. I did it. Happy?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
idea of the Rocket Car sitting on cinderblocks in the scrapyard, just
waiting for a place to run it, was driving Beck crazy. I have to
admit, I was getting anxious to take it for a test run myself, but
Beck was really going nuts. I didn't hear anything from him for the
rest of the week, and I assumed it was because he hadn't found a
suitable launch site. It was actually because his Dad had taken the
four-wheel drive out for one of his mysterious desert jaunts, and was
gone for the rest of the week. That left Beck and Sal with only one
option, driving Sal's beat-to-shit Ford Falcon, a car that barely
held its own on pavement, never mind in the desert.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile,
the Rocket Car waited in the field.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
tried to think about it as little as possible, since I didn't want to
end up afflicted with the mania had gotten hold of Beck. I worked at
the scrapyard, just as I always had, trying to avoid the far corner
of the lot where the Rocket Car was. More than once I thought about
what I'd do if my Dad suddenly got a buyer for that 1959 Chevy
Impala, but there was really no point worrying about such things. If
it happened, I was simply screwed. No way to explain my way out of a
situation like <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I
simply waited.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually,
I did get <i>one</i> minor detail taken care of during the delay,
building igniters for the JATOs. I removed all the taillights and
turn-signal lights from the Impala (no matter what became of the
Rocket Car, signaling for a turn wouldn't be an issue) and soldered
two wires to each bulb. Next I carefully cracked the glass on each
bulb, leaving the filaments intact. The bare filaments would heat to
white-hot when connected to car battery, but simply laying a hot
filament inside the JATO nozzle didn't seem like it would do the
trick. Maybe it would have, but since Beck and Sal still hadn't found
a place to use for a launch site, I had time to come up with
something better. So I pulled a dozen of the blank M-60 rounds from
the ammo belt my father kept in his office as a decoration, tore off
the skinny end of each shell, and dumped out the powder inside. I
poured a little of the powder into each of seven squares of
newspaper, folded the newspaper squares into packets around the
filaments of the light bulbs, and trussed each one up with masking
tape. When I connected one of them to a battery to test the idea, it
made an impressive little flare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely
enough to light the JATO. I hoped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
Sal and Beck <i>still</i> hadn't reported finding a launch site by
Friday morning, I even went through the trouble of putting an old car
battery on the charger at the shop, installing it in the Rocket Car,
and wiring it to a switch on the dashboard. I considered painting the
switch bright red, with the word <b><i>IGNITION!</i></b> underneath,
just because I had the time. In retrospect I'm glad I didn't go
through the trouble, since we never used the switch anyway. But at
that point I realized that if Beck and Sal didn't find a good spot
soon, I might end up hauling the car out to the nearest set of tracks
and trying it out myself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
came back from college again that weekend, just about the same time
Beck's father came back from who-knows-where with the
four-wheel-drive. During the week I had high hopes that we'd be able
to launch over the weekend, but when everyone gathered at the
scrapyard on Saturday afternoon, I knew it wasn't going to happen.
Jimmy took a look at the sprinkler system and pronounced it workable,
although I could tell he still had some grave misgivings about how
well a couple of pissing garden hoses would cool down the brake
runners. I had the same misgivings myself, but the amount of heat
generated would depend on so many unknown factors that is wasn't
something we could really plan for. We didn't have any idea how fast
the car would actually go, what shape the tracks would be in, or even
how much the car weighed. From my point of view, the sprinklers were
there for only one reason: To keep the runners from burning up like
matchsticks when they hit the rails. After all, they <i>were</i> made
from wood. If the sprinklers could keep the runners from turning into
torches, they'd fulfill my expectations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
Jimmy was inspecting the rocket car and telling us what he'd found
out about my JATO bottles (which turned out to be very little), Sal
and Beck told us about the launch locations they'd scouted out over
the week. And the news they had was grim indeed. Within ten miles of
town there were a total of three sections of track long enough to run
the rocket car on, and in my opinion they were all dead losers. Beck
and Sal knew the area well enough to realize that most of the modern
wide-gauge tracks had been laid either directly on top of, or very
close to, the places where narrow-gauge tracks had once existed. So
naturally they started their search at the switching yard near the
city limits. There they found an excellent set of narrow-gauge tracks
roughly paralleling a shiny set of wide-gauge rails that were
probably used every day. But despite the fact that the old-style
tracks stretched for miles, they ran right through a busy switching
yard. Not a good place to test a jet-propelled boxcar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another
possibility was a set of rails that started in the desert, continued
for five miles or more, and ended in a soft dirt field that would
have been ideal for cushioning any crash that might happen.
Unfortunately, this set ran directly through the middle of town, and
the field at the end was the Jaycees Softball Field, right across the
street from the police station. Even though Beck must've realized
we'd never go for <i>that</i> idea, it was obvious that he liked it.
I imagine he wanted to set the Rocket Car on the tracks across from
the police station in the dead of night, then blow the horn and
scream until a dozen cops came running out of the station to see what
the ruckus was. At that point he'd hang a moon out the window, then
light off the JATO and blaze out of town.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
maybe this wasn't what he had in mind. But if you knew Beck, you'd
probably agree with me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
last location Sal and Beck found was even worse than the tracks that
ran past the police station. The Mystery Mine was a bargain-basement
tourist attraction a few miles from town that promised to show
visitors the <b>INNER WORKINGS OF AN AUTHENTIC SILVER MINE.
</b>People who paid the $2.50 admission were loaded aboard an
ancient, rattling, mine-car and hauled through a few hundred feet of
cavern, while a tour guide in a hardhat and goggles pointed at rusted
pieces of machinery and chunks of rock, explaining what they were.
We'd all been on the Mystery Mine tour at one time or another, and
everyone agreed that the only thing even <i>vaguely</i> interesting
about it was wondering if a cave-in would trap you in the bowels of
the mine. Possibly forcing you to eat the other tourists to survive.
There was an old song that used to play on the radio that described
this scenario, and there was a popular joke around town about being
trapped in the Mystery Mine and having to eat your way out. A
discreet sign near the mine's entrance proclaimed that it was
inspected for safety by the U.S. Bureau of Mines on a yearly basis,
but everyone knew that ancient mines tended to cave in weather the
U.S. Bureau of Mines said it was okay to or not. Therefore, new folks
in town were always advised not to take the Mystery Mine tour without
packing a sharp knife and a salt shaker.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannibalism
and the U.S. Bureau of Mines really weren't our problem. But the fact
that the Mystery Mine was a tourist attraction presented all SORTS of
difficulties. The land around the Mystery Mine <i>did</i> have plenty
of narrow-gauge track, that much was true. More than enough to suit
our needs. But it also had lots of fences, lots of lights, a couple
of security guards, and a handful of vicious Dobermans that patrolled
the grounds at night. We all knew it, too. I think Beck and Sal
really just went out to the Mystery Mine to take the tour and kill an
afternoon. Jimmy and I wouldn't have even wasted time with the trip.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end
result was that the Rocket Car was ready to roll, but we had no place
to roll it. Beck and Sal were confident that they'd be able to find a
good spot the following week (since they were once again
desert-capable) but Jimmy and I had serious doubts. We knew the area
around town as well as anyone, and the chances of finding a good
place to run the car were starting to look grim.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
Jimmy spent the weekend in town, he usually headed back to the
college on Sunday evening, right after dinner. So it surprised me
when I got a call from him at 6:00 Sunday evening, asking me if I
wanted to take a ride with him to "discuss a few things". I said
sure, no trouble. He told me to drive over to his house, and when I
got there, he was already in his car. He signaled for me to follow
him, and I did. I had no idea where we were going, but I followed
anyway. After a few minutes I saw that we were heading out of town,
and I wondered what he was up to. But I stopped wondering a little
while later, when he pulled to the side of the road near the
abandoned mine shaft where we'd liberated the two ancient bucket
cars. He got out of his car, opened the trunk and took out a tire
iron, then headed toward the mine entrance without a word. When I
asked what we were doing, he held up one finger in a wait-a-minute
gesture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shut
up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
walked down the slope and stopped in front of the boards we'd
re-nailed over the entrance. Even though the sun was almost down,
there was still plenty of light to see by. I thought he'd brought the
tire iron to pry off the boards near the entrance, but when I reached
the place he was standing, he started walking down the tracks, away
from the entrance. Ten paces later he'd reached the point where the
tracks ended, buried in sand. He took a few more paces, then bent
over and jabbed the pointy end of the tire iron into the sand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my
surprise, it clanked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
looked at me with a goofy little smile on his face, and when I
realized what he was doing, I smiled myself. Probably just as
goofily. He pulled the tire iron out of the sand, walked a few more
paces, then stuck it into the ground again. No clank this time. But
when he stuck it in again, a few inches to the left, he got the same
metallic clank. He was now standing a good fifty feet from the mine
entrance, and at least twenty feet from the spot where we all assumed
the tracks terminated. He looked up at me, with that dumb smirk still
plastered across his face, and said "So, how far out do you think
these tracks actually go?"</p>

<p><img src="./cdc-0363_files/carclif8.jpg" width="590" height="52" align="bottom"></p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">SAFETY FIRST (OR SECOND)</font></b>
</center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
none of us thought to take a look at the tracks coming out of that
abandoned silver mine before this is anyone's guess. Beck and Sal and
I had stood right on top of them when we got the bucket cars, but
none of us considered the possibility that a long section of the
track might still be there, only underground. As a matter of fact
"underground" is a pretty drastic term for what we found. The tracks
were actually covered by a fairly thin layer of drifted sand and
dust. The outcrop around the mine shaft broke the wind enough to keep
the tracks clear near the entrance, but beyond that, the rails must
have been a good place for drifting sand to pile up, and eventually
cover the rails. But Jimmy's tire iron sank no more than an inch or
two before striking metal, and we didn't so much have to <i>dig</i>
for the rails as brush the sand off them. We ended up walking more
than a half mile from the mine entrance, Jimmy stopping occasionally
to stick the tire iron into the sand, and striking metal every time.
Eventually it started getting too dark to see where we were going, so
we made our way back up the slope to where the cars were parked. I
told Jimmy I'd be back bright and early the next day to find out
exactly how far the tracks ran, but Jimmy seemed confident we'd have
more than enough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
didn't seem too confident of the Rocket Car, though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
we got back to the cars, I found that Jimmy had me follow him in my
own car because he was going back to school directly from the mine
entrance. But there was still a matter he wanted to discuss, that
matter being the first run of the Rocket Car. Without a good launch
site the matter could wait, but since it seemed as if we'd found one,
Jimmy figured we'd better discuss the whole thing immediately. It
turned out that he was <i>very </i>worried about the first run of the
car, particularly the idea of having a person inside when we fired
it. Of course I already knew there were plenty of things that could
go wrong, since I'd built the thing in a junkyard. But when Jimmy
started to lay out the possible ways a person inside the car could
get hurt or killed, he made it sound a little less safe than going
over Niagara Falls in a barrel. First, we were dealing with a highly
volatile chemical propellant we knew nothing about. We didn't know
how old it was, where it came from, or how it was supposed to behave.
There was actually a very real possibility that the JATO could
explode like a bomb, reducing the car to flame and shrapnel in a
split-second. But even if it <i>did</i> work as expected, the rocket
was held in place by a length of water pipe welded to the bottom half
of a train car that was God only knew how old. If any of the welds
didn't hold, there was no telling what the outcome would be. Then
there was the matter of the brakes. All we had was a setup that
looked good and sounded like it might work. But if someone inside the
car found themselves going 100+ miles per and the brakes DIDN'T
work...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
way he described the whole thing made it sound like suicidal
insanity, and I started to get a little pissed off at him. If he'd
been thinking about all this shit the whole time, why hadn't he SAID
anything?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it
turned out, he wasn't suggesting that we scrap the project outright,
just that we perform a "test run" before trying it for real. An
<i>unmanned</i> test run. Rig a system to activate the brakes at some
point after the JATO had burned out, point the Rocket Car down the
tracks, and let it run pilotless the first time. After all, it wasn't
as if we needed a man at the tiller while the car was moving. The
person we'd been referring to as the "pilot" would actually be the
"passenger", his sole duty being to hit the dump valve before the car
ran out of track. And since we had four JATOS, wasting one for the
sake of safety seemed like a prudent move.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had
to admit, he made a LOT of sense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
pointed out that Beck would probably have a bird when he found out we
weren't going to let him drive the car on its maiden voyage, but we
both agreed that it wouldn't be a major problem as long as Beck got
to drive it on the first <i>manned</i> run. We'd just take a second
JATO along, and if the car ran successfully the first time, Beck
could take it out the second time. If the car ended up a twisted lump
of smoking metal, Beck would be happy we decided to take the
precaution.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
these details settled, I said goodbye to Jimmy and headed home. On
the way I was thinking about how to kick in the braking system with
nobody inside the car, but since we'd only need it for the trial run,
it didn't have to be anything fancy. The next day I was busy at the
yard sorting through the latest load of junk my Dad had bought at an
auction over the weekend, but I DID find time to rig the brakes for
our test run. All I did was twist a screw-eye into each brake runner,
then run a length of piano wire through the openings in each eye and
up through a hole in the Chevy's floor. I tied the ends of the wire
to a short stick, and used it to prop the brake's dump valve in the
"up" position. Then I looped a piece of rubber from a bicycle inner
tube over the lever, and tied it under the valve box. The bike tube
pulled the lever toward the "dump" position, but the lever couldn't
move due to the stick propping it up. I figured that once we found a
good section of track, all we'd have to do was drive a spike into one
of the rail-ties at the point where we wanted the brakes to kick in.
When the car passed over the spike, the spike would snag the wire,
pull out the stick, and the dump valve would snap down, activating
the brakes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now,
if you're getting tired of hearing about all the Rube Goldberg
bullshit I was adding to this machine, take a minute to think about
how I felt while I was doing the work. By the time Jimmy suggested
that "we" rig "some sort of automatic brake system", I was getting
mighty sick of rigging and drilling and bolting and cutting. Let's
face it, despite the fact that we came up with a few clever ways to
solve pretty tough problems, the Rocket Car was <i>still</i> just a
pile of shit that I knocked together in a junkyard. And I was tired
of trying to figure out ways to make important things happen by using
other people's garbage. I made up my mind that the auto-brake was the
last piece of work I was going to do on the car. If what I'd built at
that point wasn't good enough, I'd simply turn the whole mess over to
Beck and let him drive the fucking thing into the Mystery Mine, or
past the police station, or whatever he wanted to do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
there was still the matter of the launch site preparation to take
care of, so on Tuesday I called Beck and told him to swing by the
yard in his Dad's pickup and get me after work. He and Sal both
showed up, and when I took them to the abandon mine and showed them
how far from the entrance the tracks extended, they were ecstatic. I
didn't bother to explain that Jimmy had come up with the idea two
days earlier, since they'd probably spent Monday and Tuesday driving
around in the desert looking for a decent set of tracks themselves. I
brought a tire iron along, and sat on the tailgate of the pickup
while Beck drove away from the mine entrance. Every now and then he
stopped the truck, and I plunged the tire iron into the sand where
the tracks should be. And I kept striking metal over and over.
Finally the truck stopped and stayed stopped, and when I looked over
my shoulder, I saw that we'd come to the end of the line. Or at least
the end of the usable line. Exactly 1.9 miles from the mine entrance,
the narrow-gauge tracks intersected a set of modern, standard-gauge
tracks leading into town. Which made sense, after I'd thought about
it awhile. The newer tracks were probably laid on the bed of some old
narrow-gauge tracks, and the rails leading toward the abandoned mine
were probably a spur coming off the main tracks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
who cared? We had two miles of narrow gauge track, more than enough
to run the Rocket Car on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
hoped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck
was thrilled over the discovery, until I explained that the buried
rails would have to be cleared before we could take the car out for a
test run. He enthusiastically assured me that he and Sal would have
the tracks cleared the next day, but I had my doubts. And my doubts
turned out to be well-grounded. I didn't hear anything from Beck and
Sal the next day, or the day after that. I assumed they were in the
process of clearing the tracks, and it turned out they were. And the
process turned out to be a lot harder than either of them imagined.
They started out with Beck driving the truck while Sal sat on the
tailgate, dragging a street-sweepers broom along the rails. It
worked, but not as well as they expected. After driving that two-mile
stretch of track twice, Beck came up with a much better idea. They
simply broke back into the abandoned mine, grabbed the last
bucket-car we'd found near the entrance, and pushed it down the
length of the tracks with the bumper of the pickup. Once the wheels
loosened up, the bucket car worked like a snowplow and cleared the
tracks with a single pass. I had my doubts that this method worked as
well as they claimed, but when I drove out to the abandoned mine
after work on Thursday, I saw that it had. Two rusty metal rails
poked out of the hardpan, starting at the mine entrance and extending
out into the distance. When I took a closer look at the rails, I saw
that they were indeed rusty as hell, but still solid. When I banged
one with a rock, I saw plenty of good steel under the rust.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best
of all, they were straight as an arrow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
me, this was the point where the whole project made the transition
from theory to reality. I squatted next to those tracks and realized
that the last obstacle had suddenly been removed, that we really were
going to run the car. And to my surprise, it didn't feel good at all.
Suddenly the whole thing seemed stupid and insane and dangerous and
illegal as hell. But by then it was way too late to stop.</p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">COUNTING DOWN </font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the
track had been ready on Monday, I don't think I could've convinced
Beck to let the maiden voyage of the rocket car wait until Jimmy came
in on the weekend. He was far too anxious to get moving on the whole
thing. As a matter of fact, the only way I was able to get him to
wait as long as I did was by agreeing to start getting things ready
on Friday. After my Dad and I went home from the yard on Friday, I
returned to the yard and found Sal and Beck waiting for me. We backed
the flatbed into the weedy field where the Rocket Car was docked, set
up the ramps, and hoisted the car onto the flatbed with the winch. I
drove the flatbed out to the abandoned mine and down the slope to
tracks, scared shitless that I'd get the truck stuck in the soft
sand. But I made it down the slope okay, and we lowered the Rocket
Car onto the tracks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
looked perfectly at home sitting on the rails. Like that's were it
was meant to be all the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we
didn't have time to stand around admiring the way the Rocket Car
looked on the tracks. Even though we were a hundred yards from a
fairly secluded stretch of highway, the sight of a five-ton flatbed,
a four-wheel-drive pickup, and a rocket powered `59 Chevy on railroad
wheels would've looked pretty peculiar to anyone coming down the
road. So as soon as the car was on the rails, I climbed into the
Chevy's drivers' seat and Beck pushed me down the tracks with the
pickup's bumper until the car was close to the mine entrance.
Actually, it almost went <i>through</i> the boarded- up hole in the
mountain. I was sitting there enjoying the ride, halfway to the mine
entrance, when I suddenly realized that hitting the dump valve would
stop the car <i>permanently</i>. Or at least until we went back to
the scrapyard and snagged the portable compressor to re-inflate the
shocks. About a quarter mile from the mine entrance I started waving
out the window and screaming for Beck to stop, and when he finally
hit the brakes, I must've been doing about forty or so. By the time
the car coasted to a stop, I was no more than fifty feet from the
entrance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close
call.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
pulled the boards from the mine entrance again, and Beck used the
pickup to ease the Chevy into the mine. Very slowly. Once it was all
the way inside, he took me back to the flatbed, and followed me back
to the yard. I parked the flatbed where it usually spent the night,
we loaded the portable compressor into the pickup, and returned to
the mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
we didn't have a tow chain, we had to muscle the car far enough out
of the mine for Beck to get the truck in front of the Chevy and push
it back down the tracks. When we got the car about a mile from the
entrance, we let the car coast to a stop, Beck got out of the pickup,
and Sal slipped into the driver's seat. Beck jumped into the Rocket
Car with a maniac grin on his face, and Sal maneuvered the pickup
behind the Chevy. Beck gave us a jaunty thumbs-up, and Sal hit the
gas. We picked up speed until we were doing about fifty, and just
before I was about to scream at Sal to stop, he hit the brakes. We
watched the rocket car pull away at goodly clip.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
keep going.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
keep going.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
just as I was wondering if the brake system might have malfunctioned,
I saw the ass end of the Chevy pitch up slightly as Beck hit the dump
lever. Sal and I both let out the breath we'd been holding, and drove
down to where the car was stopped. When we got there, the car was
resting on the runners and Beck was sitting on the hood. Less than
twenty feet from the mine entrance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll
say it again: Beck was a fucking maniac.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
thought he might make up an excuse for waiting so long to stop, that
the brakes didn't work or whatever, but he didn't even bother. The
runners had scraped the rust off ten feet of the rails, and when I
looked under the Rocket Car, water was still squirting out of the
hoses. When I asked what the fuck was wrong with him, Beck said "Hey,
I didn't feel like pushing this fucker all the way to the garage, so
I let it coast most of the way. You have a problem with that?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually,
I didn't. The "garage" he was referring to was actually the mine
shaft, where we planned to stash the car until the firing test the
next day. Nobody wanted to go through the bullshit of hauling the car
back to the yard, so we decided to simply push it into the mine,
replace the boards, and leave it there overnight. And after
re-inflating the shocks from the compressor in the pickup, that's
exactly what we did. But every time I looked at those two bright
spots on the rails, less than twenty feet from the boards covering
that mine shaft, I wondered if it would <i>ever</i> be a good idea to
let Beck drive the thing while a rocket was pushing it.</p>

<p><img src="./cdc-0363_files/carcli10.jpg" width="590" height="52" align="bottom"></p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">LEFTOFF!</font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
first (and last) test run of the Rocket Car happened on Holy
Saturday, 1978. For the non-Christians in the house, Holy Saturday is
the day before Easter, a day the faithful are supposed to spend
preparing for the Easter feast and quietly contemplating the Miracle
of the Resurrection. My family has been Catholic for about a thousand
generations, so I suppose this put me firmly among the ranks of "The
Faithful". Which means the Pope probably would've frowned on my
spending the day before Easter experimenting with illegal military
ordnance and trespassing on private property, but I'm also confident
that nothing in the Bible covers what we were doing that Saturday
morning, so I probably had some wiggle-room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
assembled at the abandoned mine early in the morning, just before
dawn. The prefabricated story to my parents was that Jimmy and I were
driving up to.... a big city in the area (you'll excuse me if I don't
specify which one), and wanted to get an early start. Jimmy was using
the same excuse for anyone at his house who was curious. Dad wasn't
even going into the yard on Holy Saturday, so I had the day to
myself. I went to Jimmy's house and found him waiting for me on the
front porch, and we left for the mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
we arrived, I was tremendously relieved to find that Sal and Beck
were already there, sitting on the hood of the pickup, which was
parked near the mine entrance. They even had the boards pulled from
the mine entrance and the car pushed out into the open. My relief
wasn't due to the fact that they'd showed up (you couldn't have kept
Beck away with a court order) but because they were just sitting on
the hood of the pickup, patiently waiting for Jimmy and I to arrive.
See, the night before, we'd loaded two of the JATO's, the portable
compressor, and three five-gallon jerry cans of water into the back
of Beck's pickup, for convenience's sake. It was way too much stuff
to haul in my car, and we figured the gear would be safe spending the
night in Beck's truck, covered with a tarp. What hadn't occurred to
me until I got home was that Beck was in possession of everything he
needed to test the car <i>himself</i>, on the sly. I even considered
taking a ride past his house around midnight to see if the truck was
still there, when it occurred to me that even though he <i>did</i>
have the ignition button on the dashboard, he had no way to light the
rocket. And I didn't think he was stupid enough to set the car up and
strap himself in while Sal stuffed lit matches into the JATO, trying
to get it started.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal
would've done it without hesitation. But not Beck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd
like to say that depriving Beck of the igniters was a piece of
intelligent foresight on my part, but it was really exactly the
opposite. I'd just forgotten them. We had to stop at the scrapyard to
get the igniters and a hundred-foot roll of field-phone wire before
we went to the mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,
I left my car parked on the shoulder of the road, and we walked down
the slope to find that Beck and Sal were aching to get the test under
way. Beck shot a look at the igniters in my hand as he was getting
into the truck, but it was still too dark out to read his expression.
If I had to guess, I'd say it was an irritated one. Beck started the
truck and drove around to the front of the Rocket Car, then left it
in low gear as he pushed it to the opposite end of the track, with
the rest of us riding on the tailgate. It wasn't until the car was
stopped at the end of the track that Jimmy looked the car over and
asked what turned out to be a VERY important question.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
said "So why is the car pointing THIS way?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal
and Beck and I stared at the car for a minute, and although I can't
speak for the other two, I was trying to come up with something to
say. To be honest, I'd never given it much thought. I suppose that
when the car was brought to my Dad's scrapyard, it was hauled onto
the flatbed rear-first, because the front end was further from the
path winding through the yard. When we loaded the car to bring it to
the mine, winching it onto the flatbed rear-first was simply the
easiest thing to do, so that's what we did. And when we got to the
tracks, I'd simply driven the flatbed to the end opposite the mine
shaft and parked facing away from the entrance. It seemed like a good
way to avoid driving the flatbed over the tracks themselves, which
might have damaged them. So when we rolled the car down the planks
and onto the tracks, it ended up facing the mine entrance. Sure, we
could've set it on the tracks facing the opposite way, but... nobody
thought of it. Actually, nobody even thought to <i>think</i> about
it. The whole process seemed simple and straightforward, even the
part where we pushed the Chevy into the mine entrance and boarded it
up. I mean, you <i>drive</i> a car into a garage, you don't
<i>back</i> it in, right?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the
three of us gave Jimmy a shrug, and I asked him what difference it
made. He walked around the car looking thoughtful, and after awhile
said "None. This is good" But later on I figured out what he'd been
thinking about. If something went wrong with car (specifically the
brakes), which way would we want it to be pointing? If the brakes
failed while it was heading <i>away</i> from the mine, the car would
eventually run onto the wide-gauge rails at the end of <i>our</i>
track. And with the flatbed back in the yard, it wasn't likely we'd
be able to get the car off the tracks if it got stuck there. But with
the car pointed <i>toward</i> the mine, a brake failure would mean
the car simply flew into an abandoned silver mine. We could declare
the experiment a failure, nail the boards back up, and call it a day.
Of course the equation looked a lot different with a passenger on
board, but that's why we were doing a test run first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah
yes, the test run.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
Jimmy was through looking the car over, I broke the news to Beck that
the first run would be unmanned. He didn't like the sound of that a
<i>bit</i>, even after I explained to him that it was in his best
interest. Personally, I wouldn't have gone near the thing unless we'd
had at <i>least</i> one trial, but Beck's mind didn't work that way.
He wanted to ride in the car on the first run, and it took awhile to
convince him that it simply wasn't going to happen. But after a
little arguing he grudgingly accepted our logic. We took one of the
JATOS out of its crate and loaded into the pipe at the rear of the
car, then I had Sal drive me down the tracks toward the mine. When
the odometer had ticked off exactly a mile, I made him stop while I
got out and pounded an eight-inch spike into one of the wooden ties.
The lumber was still solid enough to hold the spike well, which was
nice to see, since I had no alternative plan to activate the brakes.
We drove back to the Rocket Car and found that Jimmy and Beck had
already shoved one of my igniters into the JATO nozzle, attached the
leads to the roll of field-phone cable with wirenuts, and were
unrolling the cable away from the tracks. I told Sal to park about
fifty feet away from the Chevy, with the broad side of the truck
facing the tracks. Jimmy had mentioned the chance of the JATO
exploding like a bomb when it was ignited, and I wanted to have the
pickup truck between me and the JATO when it was lit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
filled the can under the Chevy's hood with water from one of the
jerry cans, closed the hood and rigged the automatic brake. The wire
stretched between the runners was only five or six inches above the
railroad ties, and it looked low enough to catch on the spike with no
problem. Beck came over to watch the whole procedure, a little miffed
that the unmanned test had obviously been planned out well in
advance. But by then it was too late for him to raise any serious
objections. If the car ran okay, he'd get his ride. If not, he'd be
grateful we made the test.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once
the brakes were rigged and the water can filled, there was only one
thing left to do: Light the mother and see what happened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all
gathered around the truck, Beck popped the hood, and I cut the field
phone wire from the roll and stripped the ends. By then the sun had
climbed over the top of the mountains, and we had a clear view of the
entire track. I wrapped one of the field phone wires around the
corroded negative post of the truck's battery, and just as I was
about to touch the other wire to the positive, Sal yelled "Wait!"
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
scared the shit out of me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said
"What? What? What's the problem?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal
looked slightly embarrassed, and said "Shouldn't we have a
countdown?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck
gave him a smack in the back of the head, but I told him sure, if he
wanted a countdown, we'd have a countdown. So Sal counted down from
ten, and when he reached zero, I touched the wire to the lead of the
battery.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liftoff.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sequence of events that followed happened so damned fast that I'm
surprised my mind was able to record everything that occurred. But
even though parts of this story have grown foggy over the years, the
memory of the actual Flight of the Rocket Car remains crystal-clear.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I
touched the wire to battery post, we heard a little fizz from the
JATO. I knew what it was, since I'd heard it before. The igniter
going off. I didn't expect to hear it, since I figured the rocket
would light instantly. Instead, it hissed for a second, then stopped.
But before I could start to worry if the rocket was a dud, there was
a massive eruption of orange flame from the ass of the Chevy, as if
it had just laid the worst fart in history. Along with the flame was
a huge, howling roar, something nobody had counted on. We'd all seen
the Apollo launches on TV, and we <i>knew</i> that rockets were
noisy, but nothing had prepared us for this. It sounded like.... I
don't know what. Like a solid-fuel rocket igniting, I suppose. And
the noise and smoke continued for what seemed like a long time before
the Rocket Car took off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ,
scratch that. It didn't take off, it <i>JUMPED</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've
been trying to figure out a way to put it into words, but the sight
is almost impossible to describe. Think of this: You know what it
looks like when you shoot a paper clip with a rubber band? One second
the clip is between your fingers, and the next it's just... gone. You
can't track it with your eyes, because it moves too fast. All you can
do is hope to shift your eyes to where it was going, so you can see
where it hits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think
of the same thing happening with a 1500-pound car.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I
remember thinking later that there was no way in <i>hell</i> I was
<i>ever</i> going to ride in the thing. I could only imagine what
would've happened to Beck if we'd let him ride in it. I'm sure the
seat would've been torn from its mounts, and Beck probably would've
made a hasty exit through the back windshield. I don't know much
about G-forces or rocket construction, but I can't think of any way a
regular car seat could've stood up to that kind of acceleration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
space of a second, the car jumped down the track, heading away from
us, and we were enveloped in thick, chemical-smelling smoke. Another
bit of poor planning. We all ran up the slope to get out of the
artificial fogbank, but the roar from the rocket stopped as quickly
as it started. Jimmy says the burn time on our JATO was 2.2 seconds,
but at the time it seemed a <i>lot</i> longer than that. I staggered
up the slope and looked down the tracks, to see that the Rocket Car
was moving along at a rapid pace, toward the spike I'd driven in the
railroad tie. And although it was moving damned fast, it was far
enough away so that I can't even take a guess as to how fast it was
going. My eyes were still burning from the rocket smoke, but I did
see it pass the point where I'd planted the spike, and then...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something
happened.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectually,
I know exactly what happened. The spike caught the piano wire, pulled
the stick out from under the dump-valve lever, and the air shocks
lowered the car to the rails. I didn't actually see the car drop, but
it must have happened. Because a second later, more smoke started
pouring out of the car. Only this time it was coming from
<i>under</i> the car, and it was steam, not smoke. The runners had
heated up, and the water shooting onto the hot brakes was turning
into steam.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it
kept going.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
going.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
didn't seem to be slowing down very much, either. It <i>must</i> have
been, since the runners were obviously pushing against the rails hard
enough to create a lot of heat. But I guess it wasn't enough. The car
kept moving, closer and closer to the mine. The last coherent thought
I had was that it had been a <i>very</i> good move to point the car
toward the mine. It was still moving at a good clip, highway-speed at
least, when it was fifty yards from the entrance. It obviously wasn't
going to stop in time, and I remember wondering just how far into the
mine it would go before stopping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it
never made to the entrance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later
on, Jimmy and I had a long discussion about what happened next, but
we were too far away for anyone to have a clear view. Maybe one of
the runners burned away and got caught in the ground. Or on the
tracks. Maybe one of the old axles finally reached its breaking
point. Or one of my welds couldn't take the strain. Whatever it was,
the Rocket Car derailed about twenty yards from the mine entrance. It
still had plenty of inertia, and continued moving toward the mine,
but the wheels were no longer on the tracks. Actually it was
straddling one of the rails, screeching and screaming and kicking up
a cloud of sparks from the point where the frame slid along the rail.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
it was no longer aligned with the mine entrance, either.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things
were still moving too fast for my brain to process the information,
but when I saw the car skidding toward the mine entrance at sixty or
seventy miles an hour, and <i>not</i> firmly on the rails, I knew
that Something Bad Was About To Happen. Exactly <i>what</i> was still
a mystery at that point, but a second later I found out. The Chevy
slid down the tracks, but instead of driving through the mine
entrance, it went in at an angle with the ass end canted toward the
road. The front end smashed into one of the huge timbers that
outlined the mine entrance, cracking it in half. After a very short
pause, the timber collapsed, immediately followed by the overhead
timber it supported. Those timbers must have been under considerable
stress, because a second later the entire entrance to the mine
collapsed on top of the Rocket Car with a huge grinding rumble and a
cloud of dust.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just
gawked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
remember that part clearly, standing there looking at the car in the
distance, just before dust obscured the picture. My Rocket Car was
sitting there like a busted Tonka truck while a mountain fell on it.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
almost cried.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
second later I became aware of voices shouting behind me. I turned
around and saw Jimmy and Sal in the bed of the pickup, and Beck
behind the wheel. They'd obviously had the sense to get into the
truck and chase down the rocket car, while I stood there with my
mouth hanging open. I jumped into the bed, and Beck floored it toward
the mine entrance. Toward the <i>former</i> mine entrance. During the
short ride I was wondering how we were going to haul the car out of
the pile of rubble and get it out of there, but when we got closer I
saw that it was a foolish idea. The front half of the car was crushed
like a beer can, under boulders ranging from the size of a watermelon
to the size of the car itself. Smaller pieces were still coming down
when we got there. The only way that car was ever coming out was if
someone torched off the back end and hauled it out with a winch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
front end was never going to see the light of day again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck
stopped the truck a safe distance from the wreckage, and we all got
out to look. But there wasn't much to look at. The only thing
<i>not</i> buried by the cave-in was the last four feet of the car,
and that was about it. The trunk lid and rear bumper were visible,
but the rest of the car was buried under boulders and rubble. It was
obvious that the car would have to stay were it was, but after we
gaped at it awhile, I decided that there <i>was</i> one part of the
Rocket Car that absolutely couldn't stay where it was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rocket itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to
that point we were guilty of little more than trespassing. Sure we'd
caused a mine to cave in, but the mine had been closed for decades,
and it wasn't likely anyone would be too upset about it. But that
fucking JATO bottle was sticking out of the wreckage in a <i>very</i>
obvious way, and had to go. So I cautiously made my way over to the
remains of the Chevy, hoping an expended JATO would be a lot lighter
than the full one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave
it a tug, but it wouldn't budge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beck
came over and gave me a hand, but we still couldn't make it move. It
wouldn't even wiggle. All we could figure was that the pipe must have
been twisted or squashed further in, where we couldn't see it. After
a little more grunting and pushing, Beck went back to the pickup for
his jack. We figured that if we took some of the weight off the pipe,
we might be able to budge the rocket. But before he could get back,
the pile of rubble shifted, sending a good-sized boulder careening
past me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly
jacking the car up seemed like a very poor idea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
shortly after that, even staying in the area didn't seem very smart.
Jimmy quickly summed the situation up for us. At that particular
moment, there wasn't much we could do in the way of damage control.
The car was stuck, and there was nothing we could do about it. The
JATO was wedged in too tightly to remove too. And if <i>we</i>
couldn't move it, then it was unlikely anyone else could. Not without
a major effort. Fortunately, the only thing to show that we'd even
<i>been</i> there was the piece of field-phone wire at the other end
of the tracks, and the remains of the Rocket Car itself. Which meant
that it was an excellent time to get the hell out of there, before
someone came down the road and wondered what was going on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
needed no more encouragement. Beck and Sal ran for the cab of the
pickup, Jimmy and I piled into the bed, Beck pointed the truck toward
the road, and stomped the gas. I guess he didn't have the four-wheel
drive engaged, because the back wheels of the truck threw up
rooster-tails of sand as we took off up the slope, but not the front
wheels. But we didn't get stuck, which was the one thing I was afraid
of. We shot up the slope, bounced onto the asphalt, and as soon as
the rear wheels hit the asphalt they started burning rubber. Beck
steered back toward town, only stopping long enough for Jimmy and I
to bail out and run to my car. I jumped in and started, it, but Jimmy
ran back down the slope, toward the end of the railroad track. I
yelled after him, but instead of yelling back, he stooped and grabbed
something from the ground.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
field-phone wire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
was reeling it up in his hands as he ran back up the slope, and when
he reached the car he tossed the wad of wire in the back seat and
jumped in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
punched the gas, spun the car around, and headed back toward town.
And that was the last I ever saw of the Rocket Car.</p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">COVERUP</font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
there you go. That's the whole story of the Rocket Car, or at least
the part that I was involved with. I never went back to the mine, and
as far as I know, neither did Jimmy. We discussed what we'd do about
the wreckage while driving back to town, but nothing we came up with
seemed to make a lot of sense. The road running past the mine wasn't
very well-travelled, but we knew that the only reason we hadn't been
spotted was because the whole thing happened so early in the morning.
If we went back to the site later that day, there was a fair chance
we'd be spotted. Of course we'd taken that chance before, especially
during the brake test the day before. But then we had the option of
rolling the car into the mine shaft and getting out of there if
anyone seemed curious. And at the very worst, we'd get nailed for
putting train wheels on a Chevy, then sticking it on an abandoned
track. I'm pretty sure there no law against <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
now there was a very obvious piece of forbidden military hardware in
plain view, and no easy way to get it out of there. The thing that
kept repeating over and over in my head as I drove back to town was
that paragraph in my Dad's auction paperwork. The one dealing with
possession of controlled military hardware. Specifically, the part
detailing prison sentences and outrageous fines. It was then that I
started to think that the best way to handle the whole thing would be
to not handle it at all. Pretend it never happened, and hope nobody
connected the car wreck to us.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
that's exactly what we did.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually,
timing and nature lent a hand. The following day was Easter Sunday,
and there was no way Jimmy or I were going to avoid spending it with
our families. And even if we wanted to, it wasn't a good day to be
screwing around out in the desert. Late Saturday night a windstorm
kicked up, strong enough to make the local TV stations interrupt
programming with traveler's advisories in our area. Nothing very odd
about that, not in our area in the springtime. Actually it was a
pretty common occurrence. But this time I was thrilled to hear the
reports. High winds and blowing sand could only serve to obscure the
signs of what we'd been doing in the desert that morning, and the
fewer signs, the better. When I got up on Easter morning, I saw
patches of sand that had blown around on the street in front of the
house, and was encouraged by the sight. If sand was blowing across
the streets in the middle of town, it must've really been kicking ass
in the desert. Later that morning I saw Jimmy at church, and even
though we weren't alone long enough to talk about anything, we
exchanged several Significant Looks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the next day, Jimmy went back to college.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went
back to work at the scrapyard, and I have no idea what Beck and Sal
did. I just spent the next few days trying to act as normal as
possible, expecting a police car to show up at the yard any minute.
But curiosity finally got the best of me, and I called Beck on
Wednesday. We met that night at the same bar where we'd discussed
brakes for the Rocket Car, and Beck told me he <i>had</i> been out to
the mine, actually a couple of times. Once he even brought a camera
and took a few pictures, because what he saw was so damned funny.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Funny?
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
couldn't figure out what he could think was funny about the whole
thing, since I was there when it happened. But he explained it to me,
and afterwards I had to agree, it WAS kind of funny. The storm that
blew through the area on Saturday night had indeed eliminated most of
the signs of what we'd been doing near the mine over the past few
days. The tire tracks made by his Dad's pickup were completely
eliminated, and the railroad tracks themselves were almost re-buried.
But the Rocket Car was still exactly the same as it was when we left,
ass end hanging out of a pile of rubble with a rocket sticking out of
it. I'd hoped Beck was going to tell me that drifting sand had
covered the remains of the car, but it hadn't.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was
waiting for the funny part, but it didn't seem to be coming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally Beck
reminded me of what the scene looked like to a person driving
<i>toward</i> the crash site. I had to visualize it, since I'd never
actually seen it. You drive down the stretch of road, toward a butte
that used to have a mine entrance in the side of it. But now there
<i>is</i> no mine shaft, just the rear end of a car sticking out of
the side of the butte.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And,
of course, the twin skidmarks on the highway where Beck's truck
leaped onto the roadway. Skidmarks pointing directly at the Rocket
Car. Just like you'd see in a Roadrunner cartoon.</p>

<p><img src="./cdc-0363_files/carcli12.jpg" width="590" height="52" align="bottom"></p>

<p></p><center><b><font size="+2">AFTERMYTH</font></b></center><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
you go.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I
have to admit one thing, I didn't start hearing any Rocket Car rumors
right away. Nobody did. I didn't see any articles in the paper, the
cops never came to visit anyone (not that I'm aware of, anyway) and I
never went back to see what happened with the Rocket Car.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanations?
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
guess is as good as mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
town I've been talking about isn't a huge one, but it's not small
enough so that everyone knows each other's business, either. The road
wasn't a busy one, and although the Rocket Car was visible to someone
driving past, they could easily miss it. All I can say for sure is
that whoever discovered the car sticking out of the butte didn't make
a big fuss about it. And I'm pretty sure someone <i>did</i> discover
it. I saw Beck once more after our meeting in the bar, at a Memorial
Day party a few weeks later. He was pretty drunk at the party, wanted
to talk about the whole thing, and I had a bitch of a time getting
him to a private spot so I could listen to what he had to say. He
said he'd gone out to the crash site a few days earlier, and the
Rocket Car was gone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said
"What do you mean, gone?"</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
"gone" is just what he meant. He drove past the spot, couldn't see
the car from the highway, and went down the slope to take a look.
When he got there, he couldn't find any trace of the car ever having
been stuck in the mine entrance. All I could think at the time is
that the rubble-pile must have eventually shifted to the point where
it covered the car completely. Beck seemed doubtful when I suggested
it, but like I said, he was pretty drunk at the time. He said it
looked more like the car was pulled out of the hole and taken away,
but that's a bunch of bullshit. It has to be. To start with, none of
us were there long enough for the scene to form a lasting impression.
We looked at the wreckage for maybe fifteen minutes before we were
back in Beck's truck and hauling ass out of there. Maybe Beck saw
enough so that he could tell if the car had been moved, but I
wouldn't be able to tell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the
other hand...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later
on I started thinking about what would have happened if the county
sheriff had driven by and seen the Chevy sticking out of a rockslide.
Or even if someone had called the sheriff and reported it. See, the
abandoned mine was far enough from town so that it probably wasn't
inside the city limits, which means that it wouldn't be the business
of the city cops. And folks who don't live in town learn real quickly
who they're supposed to call when there's trouble. So if the site was
spotted by someone who didn't live in town, chances are they'd have
called the sheriff. Of course it <i>might</i> have been the business
of the State Police, but I don't know anyone who'd call the State
Police in a situation like this. Most people wouldn't even know
<i>how</i> to call the State Police. Oh, I'm sure a trooper would've
stopped to check it out if he'd spotted it while driving past, but
the troopers mainly stick to the Interstates, occasionally pulling
into one of the towns along the way for donuts or coffee. No, if some
law-enforcement outfit stopped to investigate the crash site, it
almost certainly would've been the county sheriff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
what would <i>he</i> have done?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
honestly don't know. I've got no idea if they have set procedures for
dealing with stuff like this (yeah, Section 203.1 of the Civil Code,
Disposal of Jet-Propelled Railroad Equipment), but the sheriff's
office wouldn't have called the city cops unless they <i>had</i> to.
My Dad always hinted that there was some animosity between the two
departments, the city cops considering the sheriff's department a
bunch of hick-assed Deputy Dawgs, and the sheriff's department
thinking the city cops were a gang of self-important pricks. And
neither group liked the State Police, who, by all accounts, ARE
self-important pricks. If someone from the sheriff's department came
along the wreckage of the Rocket Car, I doubt like hell they'd have
told any other law-enforcement agencies unless they <i>had</i> to.
And until they found out if there was a body inside the car, there
really wouldn't <i>be</i> any reason to share the info. So their next
logical step would be to find out if there was anyone inside the car.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dig
through the rubble? That's about the only way it could be
accomplished. But it sure as hell isn't a job for the county sheriff
and a couple of deputies with shovels. It would take heavy equipment
and people who knew what they were doing. On the other hand, why go
through the trouble? When you see a car that appears to be plugged
directly into a mountainside, you don't even assume that there are
any survivors. I try to think of what the sheriff would've done if
he'd come across the crash site, and it occurs to me that the first
thing he'd have seen was what appeared to be a rocket nozzle sticking
out of the back end of a car. If I were the sheriff, I'd have
immediately called the Army base where Dad and I got the JATOS in the
first place. Who else would be qualified to deal with such a thing?
NASA? Evel Knievel?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if
the Sheriff <i>did</i> call the Army, and they had some EOD people
come out and take a look, anything could've happened next. The
military bomb-squad might have taken one look at the expended rocket,
told someone at the base to send out a truck with a winch, and they
may have yanked the car right out of the rubble and taken it away.
After they determined that there was no corpse in the car, it
wouldn't be the sheriff's business anymore. Or anyone else's.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case
closed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I
never did any serious investigation of these possibilities, for two
reasons. One, I didn't want to do any snooping that might look
suspicious. Two, I didn't hang around town very long after that. Two
weeks after the test of the Rocket Car, I drove to.... the big-ish
city I mentioned earlier, and took the ASVAB test. That's the test
they give you before you join the military. And a few weeks after
talking to Beck for the last time, I shipped out for Navy basic
training.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
you make any assumptions about my joining the Navy to escape the
repercussions of the Rocket Car incident, let me tell you that I
absolutely did <i>not</i>. Get that thought right out of your head.
I'd been thinking about it for a long time, and if the Rocket Car had
anything to do with my joining the Navy, it was just to give me a
gentle nudge in a direction I was already heading. Hey, take a look
at the situation I was in. I was 22 years old, living with my
folks,and working for my Dad in a junkyard at the edge of a shitty
little town in the desert. Not exactly A Future With Promise. I guess
college was a possibility, but Dad didn't really make enough to pay
my way, and I didn't feel like re-paying student loans until I was
100 years old.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
the Navy? Well, because of that song by the Village People, of
course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No,
no, just a little joke there. Don't <i>EVEN</i> take that seriously.
Actually, there was never any question about which branch of the
service I wanted to join. I joined the Navy because I wanted to get
as far away from the desert as I possibly could. Some people grow up
around sand and scrub and get to like it, they can't imagine living
anywhere else. Some (like me) take a look around and realize they've
always hated it, and didn't want to hang around for another minute.
For awhile I thought I'd be considered an oddball when the rest of
the sailors found out where I came from, but I found out it wasn't as
uncommon as I assumed. Take a look at a list of the home towns of all
Navy members, and you'll see that quite a few of the boys come from
Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and southern Texas. Joining the Navy to
get away from the desert turns out to be a pretty common practice.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,
I went home on leave whenever I got a chance, and saw Jimmy whenever
I went back. On my second visit, I found out that Beck and Sal had
hauled stakes and split for California a few months after I'd left
for boot camp. Not on foot, either. They'd stolen their Dad's monster
pickup, but rumor had it their Dad never even swore out a complaint
about the theft of his truck. Maybe he figured it was a small price
to pay to get rid of his sons for good. Or maybe the truck wasn't
empty when they jumped in and headed west. Their Dad was still up to
unknown hanky-panky out in the desert somewhere, hanky-panky that
quite possibly involved the distribution of illegal vegetation from
Mexico. Beck and Sal may have been waited for an occasion where Dad
brought some work home with him, and headed for California with a few
bales of Columbian contraband in the bed. I wouldn't put it past
them. And if that <i>is</i> what happened, I doubt Dad would've been
too anxious for the cops to collect his boys. Or his cargo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever
the case, nobody ever found out. The next update I got on <i>that</i>
situation was the following Christmas. My Dad told me that Beck had
been busted in California for God-only-knew what, and had died in
prison. The facts were sketchy, but I didn't press details. Dad
obviously considered it a case of "good riddance" but didn't actually
say the words, because he knew Beck was a friend of mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sal
was MIA, and as far as I know, nobody ever heard from him again. But
without Beck to take care of him, it's doubtful that he came to a
good end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So
that leaves Jimmy. He finished college, got his degree, and started
working for a big company, designing various kinds of equipment. I
don't want to specify the company, or even the exact type of
equipment. Let's just say that you'd recognize the company name if I
mentioned it, and Jimmy is head of the department that builds
machines for making cold things hot and hot things cold. If that's
not good enough for you, too bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Dad
kept the scrapyard, continued going to auctions and making a profit,
all the way up until he retired last year. He and Mom moved to
Phoenix, where they're probably the only retired couple who don't
complain about the heat. They came up to visit a few months ago, to
see Lily and me and the kids, and while they were here I took my Dad
out one night to shoot some pool. I told him the story of the Rocket
Car, not knowing what his reaction would be. I was more than a little
pleased to see that he laughed so hard that I thought I'd end up
having to call the paramedics. Seems that over the years he
<i>had</i> heard various bullshit-artists mention a car driven into a
cliff, but nobody ever provided any specifics, so he's always
dismissed it as just another stupid story. The one important thing he
had to say on the subject did <i>not</i> please me, not even a
little. When I told him about how I built the car, I mentioned that I
didn't want to take one of the parachutes from the shed, because I
knew he'd find out one was missing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He
said "You mean there were still some parachutes left in that shed?
Shit I'd thought I'd sold them all."</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of
a bitch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
and I drifted apart while I was in the Navy, but we got back in touch
once I got my discharge and started college. I know 26 is a pretty
ripe old age to be a freshman, but I'd taken a bunch of courses and
equivalency tests during my hitch in the Navy, so it only took two
years to finish off my degree. One thing about living on a ship, you
have plenty of time to study. I've stayed in touch with Jimmy over
the years, he's met my family and I've met his, but beyond the
occasional phone call and Christmas card, we haven't been very close.
Part of it is that we live pretty far apart, and part of it the
pressures of family, careers, etc. But Jimmy never forgot about the
Rocket Car, and over the years he's taken great joy in tweaking my
balls about it from time to time. Every now and then I'd get
something in the mail to remind me of the whole thing, something
Jimmy thought I'd think was funny. At first it was just the odd
newspaper clipping or magazine article, but once VCR's became
popular, he started sending videotapes. And even though there was
never a note or explanation with a tape he sent, I always knew what
to look for when I watched the movie. One was "The Right Stuff", and
I laughed out loud when scenes of the rocket-sled tests came on the
screen. Another was more recent, a Charlie Sheen flick called
"Terminal Velocity". I kept my eyes peeled for whatever it was Jimmy
wanted me to see, and sure enough, there was a scene where Charlie
and some blonde bimbo escape from the bad guys in a homemade rocket
sled.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got
a chuckle out of that one, too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
one movie he sent that I <i>didn't</i> find very amusing came a few
years ago, at a point where I hadn't heard anything from Jimmy in a
long time. A box came in the mail, and when I opened it up, it was a
videotape, just like the others. But instead of being a stand-alone
movie, this was the third part of a three-movie series. And although
I'd seen the first one a couple of times (it was old enough to be
shown on network TV by then), I'd never seen the second part. So I
had to rent Part II at the video store down the street, which I
watched with my family one Friday night. The next day my wife took
the kids to visit her parents, and I stayed home and put Jimmy's
movie in the VCR. And I must admit, I DID enjoy it, but the
similarities between the movie and our little adventure in 1978 were
too close for comfort at some points. The part at the beginning of
the movie, where Doc Brown and Marty McFly find the DeLorean in the
abandoned mine shaft was bad enough. But toward the end, when they
mounted railroad wheels on the time-machine and pushed it down the
tracks with the locomotive...</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I
said, too close for comfort. And I'm really glad I watched that movie
alone. I don't know what sort of expression was on my face while I
watched, but it must've been a scary one. As a matter of fact, when
the movie was over, I got up close to the TV and read each and every
name in the credits. I didn't think I'd actually find a name I'd
recognize, but we never <i>did</i> find out what happened to Sal
after he was left on his own in California.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
guess we never will. Not for sure, anyway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,
that's my story, take it or leave it. And even if everyone who sees
it thinks it's bullshit, I'm glad I told it. If I never decided to
sit down and tell it, my wife probably never would've given me this
nifty computer last Christmas. As a result, I not only got to write
most of it from the comfort of my own bedroom, but I've also
re-established contact with Jimmy. E-mail is a terrific way to stay
in touch with people, and as soon as I told Jimmy I was going to
write this whole thing down, he started spouting out facts and
details I'd long since forgotten. That's one of the reasons this
story is running so long. So I suppose that if an apology has to be
made, it should be a <i>joint</i> apology from Jimmy as well as me.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One
last thing before I call it quits:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I
originally ran this story up the flagpole for Jimmy, he looked around
on the Web for the "Darwin Awards" I'd told him about, and was as
shocked as I was at how far and wide the Rocket Car story had spread.
But he also seemed a little miffed about the whole thing. He seemed
to think that if anyone deserved the Darwin Award, it was <i>us</i>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's
tough to tell just how serious a person is when you're carrying on a
conversation via E-mail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
pointed out that not only was the Darwin Award completely
intellectual in nature (I doubt like hell a gold-plated trophy exists
anywhere), but it was <i>not</i> the sort of thing a person goes out
of his way to win.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jimmy
thought differently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have
you ever seen those silver Jesus-fish emblems that Christians
decorate their bumpers with? Well, not too long ago, someone came up
with a variation on the emblem, sort of a counterpart to the
Christian fish. It's the same outline of the fish that the Christians
use, but instead of saying "Jesus" (or whatever) inside the body of
the fish, it says "Darwin". And the fish itself has little feet on
the underside. The message (for those academic enough to grasp it) is
supposed to be a rebuttal of sorts. Evolution over creation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very
cerebral, eh?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,
I've seen these things around from time to time, both the Christian
version and the Darwin version. And to be honest, neither one made
much of an impression. But this past Easter, I got yet another
package from Jimmy, the first one in a long time. I thought it was
another video, but when I opened it up, I found it wasn't. Inside was
a Hallmark card congratulating me on a happy 20th anniversary. Along
with the card was one of the fish emblems, the "Darwin" version
instead of the standard Christian model. But not <i>exactly</i> the
Darwin version. Instead of little feet at the bottom of the fish,
this one had little wheels. And there were curly lines coming from
the rear of the fish. Lines that looked like jet exhaust, coming from
a tail that looked surprisingly like a JATO exhaust nozzle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe
Jimmy had a novelty store make it up, or maybe he made it himself.
Myself, I like to think the latter. But I ran right out to my car (a
boring old Toyota Camry, gasoline-powered), wiped down the trunk lid,
and stuck it on. And even though nobody else knows what the hell it
is, I get a chuckle every time I look at it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
ain't a gold statue, but it's good enough for me.</p>
